availability checks of critical services and another agent based monitor that
reports various system metrics. Neither of these monitoring tools offer
sensible free plans.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I recently setup &lt;a href="http://monitor.us">monitor.us&lt;/a> to do external monitoring of
my VPS hosts. It&amp;rsquo;s very good and offers many tests (internal and external),
smartphone apps and reports. All are available on the free plan. However, the
user interface is cumbersome, the reports are ugly and it feels too formal for
my personal use. Therefore I no longer use it, but it does a job, so give it a
try.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t require agent based systems monitoring. Simple external availability
monitoring is all I need for the few personal websites and services I run.
So I went off to find and alternative and after some &lt;em>google-fu&lt;/em> I found
&lt;a href="https://www.statuscake.com/?aff=1963">StatusCake&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.statuscake.com/?aff=1963">StatusCake&lt;/a> is easy to configure, offers
monitoring of http(s), TCP ports and ICMP Ping. Notifications can be delivered via
Boxcar, Pushover, NotiApp, Skype, Twitter, email and SMS. &lt;a href="https://www.statuscake.com/?aff=1963">StatusCake&lt;/a>
also looks beautiful and their &lt;a href="https://www.statuscake.com/at-statuscake-we-like-real-website-testing/">Real Browser Testing&lt;/a>
feature is very interesting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Several plans are available at attractive prices and the free plan supports
unlimited sites. Brilliant! Perfect for personal use. &lt;a href="https://www.statuscake.com/?aff=1963">StatusCake&lt;/a>
has only been around since August 2012 (as far as I can tell) but is already
shaping up to be real contender to &lt;a href="https://www.pingdom.com/">Pingdom&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What monitoring services are you using?&lt;/p></description><summary>Service availability monitoring using StatusCake</summary></item><item><title>Today I have been mostly lovin' Munin</title><link>https://wimpysworld.com/posts/today-i-have-been-mostly-lovin-munin/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Apr 2006 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>martin@wimpress.com (Martin Wimpress)</author><guid>https://wimpysworld.com/posts/today-i-have-been-mostly-lovin-munin/</guid><description>&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s the blurb from the authors&amp;hellip; &lt;a href="http://munin.projects.linpro.no/">Munin&lt;/a>
surveys all your computers and remembers what it saw. It presents all the
information in in graphs through a web interface. Its emphasis is on plug and
play capabilities. After completing a installation a high number of monitoring
plugins will be playing with no more effort. Using Munin you can easily
monitor the performance of your computers, networks, SANs, and quite possibly
applications as well. It makes it easy to determine &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rsquo;s different today&amp;rdquo;
when a performance problem crops up. It makes it easy to see how you&amp;rsquo;re doing
capacity wise on all limited resources.&lt;/p></description><summary>Munin offers simple system monitoring graphs</summary></item></channel></rss>
