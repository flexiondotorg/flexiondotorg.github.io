spare and re-installed Debian Sarge 3.1, this time I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother with the
2.6 kernel or Xfce because I&amp;rsquo;ve had my fun with those now. But playing
around with Linux on my Libretto has re-kindled my interested in running Linux
on small portable devices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Earlier this year I experimented with &lt;a href="http://familiar.handhelds.org/">Familiar Linux&lt;/a>
0.8.2 on my iPAQ 3970 and installed via a serial cable, which was very slow
going. So I&amp;rsquo;ve invested in a 512MB Compact Flash card to speed up my next
round of tinkering with Familiar but this time I intend to leave Familiar
installed and not re-flash the 3970 with PocketPC 2002. The
&lt;a href="http://familiar.handhelds.org/releases/v0.8.2/install/index.html">Familiar v0.8.2 Installation&lt;/a>
guide covers pretty much everything you need to know about the installation
process.&lt;/p></description><summary>Craving a handheld Linux device</summary></item></channel></rss>
