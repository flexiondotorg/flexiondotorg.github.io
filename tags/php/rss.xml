&lt;p>Back in April I released a script to create a MPEG video summarising a movie
using data from IMDB, you can find the original post in the URL below to learn
why I created such a script in the first place.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="2009-04-imdb-film-summary-mpeg2-video.html">IMDB Film Summary as a MPEG-2 video&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Today I&amp;rsquo;ve released v2.0 of that script, which is almost a complete re-write
mostly thanks to Eric at &lt;a href="http://yPass.net/">yPass.net&lt;/a> who contributed
significantly. Thanks to Eric the script is much improved since version 1.0,
here is a run down of what&amp;rsquo;s new.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="v20-2009-19th-september">v2.0 2009, 19th September.&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Merged yet more contributions from Eric, &lt;a href="http://www.ypass.net">http://www.ypass.net&lt;/a>. Thanks Eric!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Added usage instructions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Added categorisation by Certificate.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Added dynamic computation of video bitrate.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Added silent audio generation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Added a shell script to reprocess an entire film store.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Re-added MPEG-2 video encoding.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Improved video encoding speed by removing pre-processing with &lt;code>jpeg2yuv&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fixed spiffy animations when cover art is not available.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fixed spiffy animations on platforms that may have incomplete GD.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Modified filename input so that an input filename is optional rather than mandatory.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>Merged extensive contributions from Eric, &lt;a href="http://www.ypass.net">http://www.ypass.net&lt;/a>. Thanks Eric!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Updated the README to reflect Eric&amp;rsquo;s changes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>MPEG-4 video encoding replaced MPEG-2 video encoding.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Never released to the public.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As it stands the IMDB-to-MPEG script does what I require, so I will maintain it
in it&amp;rsquo;s current form. However, Eric has been working on a new direction by
adding support for NetFlix, creating a GUI with php-gtk and some other cool
stuff. While Eric has shared the details with me, I simply don&amp;rsquo;t have the time
to add all that good stuff to IMDB-to-MPEG, so if you like the sound of what
Eric has been up to hop over to his site to find out more.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;ve read my blog before you&amp;rsquo;ll know I run Mediatomb DLNA server with my
PlayStation 3 as the client, You&amp;rsquo;ll also know I am working towards importing my
entire DVD collection into my Mediatomb server. However, my wife wants to know
something about each film in the library without having to dig out the DVD
case from storage. My solution is to include a MPEG-2 video displaying the
film summary in the Mediatomb library for each DVD I have imported so it can
be easily viewed from the PS3.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My script is called IMDB-to-MPEG and I&amp;rsquo;ve finally got round to uploading it.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/flexiondotorg/IMDB-to-MPEG">IMDB-to-MPEG&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The scripts takes one parameter as input, a film title. The plotline, year of
release, genres, cast list and running time for that film are gathered from IMDB
and formatted as text. Here is an example.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> The Usual Suspects (1995)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> A boat has been destroyed, criminals are dead, and
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> the key to this mystery lies with the only
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> survivor and his twisted, convoluted story
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> beginning with five career crooks in a seemingly
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> random police lineup. (106 mins)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Starring Stephen Baldwin as Michael McManus,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Gabriel Byrne as Dean Keaton, Benicio Del Toro as
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Fred Fenster, Kevin Pollak as Todd Hockney, and
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Kevin Spacey as Roger &amp;#39;Verbal&amp;#39; Kint.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Genres: Crime, Mystery, Thriller.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Rated 8.7 out of 10 from 227,964 votes.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The text is converted into an image and then encoded into a MPEG-2 video using
the lowest possible bitrate/resolution that is acceptable to read when viewing
on a 42&amp;quot; plasma from my sofa.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Directories for each matching genre are created and also one for the IMDB
rating (rounded down). The MPEG-2 is stored in the &amp;lsquo;All&amp;rsquo; folder and then
symlinked to the genres and rating for that film. I then copy my video into
the appropriate directory in &amp;lsquo;All&amp;rsquo;. For example.&lt;/p>

wife I and to use. You see, like most men I have no idea when and where I am
supposed to be. This is because my wife keeps all this information in her
filofax and that lives in her handbag, somewhere I never venture. So I have
spent this evening setting up &lt;a href="http://phpicalendar.net/">PHP iCalendar&lt;/a> on
&lt;a href="http://www.lighttpd.net/">Lighttpd&lt;/a>, and I am very happy with the results.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have opted to use the &lt;code>publish.php&lt;/code> add-on provided with PHP iCalendar, rather
than add the WebDAV module to Lighty. For our modest requirements it works
very well. We now have full read/write access to our calendar by using the
&lt;a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/">Lightning&lt;/a> extension for
Thunderbird and read only access via the PHP iCalendar web interface. Viewing
the calendar via the web interface requires a login first and the calendar
publishing is protected by Lighty authentication using htdigest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lastly, because our calendar is a nice open standard I have options as to how I
might sync it with my mobile phone. More on that when I figure it out.&lt;/p></description><summary>Creating a self-hosted shared calendar</summary></item><item><title>Flexion.Org is re-activated!</title><link>https://wimpysworld.com/posts/flexion.org-is-re-activated/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Sep 2007 11:22:43 +0000</pubDate><author>martin@wimpress.com (Martin Wimpress)</author><guid>https://wimpysworld.com/posts/flexion.org-is-re-activated/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have finally got around to re-activating this website after many months of
neglect. The first thing to do was move away from &lt;a href="http://jaws-project.com/">Jaws&lt;/a>.
Sadly, my Jaws installation is broken in a way that newer Jaws releases refuse
to upgrade it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did some research and decided to migrate to &lt;a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress&lt;/a>
since it caters for all the essentials I require either in the core
functionality or via plugins. Plus I can integrate with some other stuff I want
to use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The migration to Wordpress was made all the easier thanks to the excellent &lt;a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4184">Jaws import plugin&lt;/a>
I found on the Wordpress trac. However, I decided not to use the Textile plugin
to preserve the Jaws formatted text. Instead I chose to manually clean up some
of the old entries so I could stick with the TinyMCE editor long term.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am happy with Wordpress thus far and look forward to getting some plugins
going and picking up a new theme over the coming days and weeks.&lt;/p></description><summary>Jaws dropped in a move to Wordpress</summary></item><item><title>R3-born 0.1.1 is released!</title><link>https://wimpysworld.com/posts/r3-born-0.1.1-is-released/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Mar 2007 21:59:45 +0000</pubDate><author>martin@wimpress.com (Martin Wimpress)</author><guid>https://wimpysworld.com/posts/r3-born-0.1.1-is-released/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/r3-born/">R3-born&lt;/a> 0.1.1 is released :-)&lt;/p>

what the heck. &lt;a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/r3-born/">R3-born&lt;/a> is
intended to be a simple and modular content management system for modest websites.
My hope is that it will be ideal for individuals running their own sites or for
small community websites. R3-born is coded in PHP (4.2.0 or better required)
and requires an SQL database, currently MySQL 3.x, 4.x and 5.x, Postgres 7.x
or better and MS-SQL 7.x or better are supported.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="current-status">Current Status&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Right now, R3-born is considered pre-alpha and not suitable for a production
website but is ready for testers to start feeding back on bugs, feature requests
and in the near future code changes. Development has been fairly rapid so far. I
started the project in April 2006 and I hope to release a beta version of
R3-born later in 2006.&lt;/p>

has spam protection and captachs but both implementations suck. This site doesn&amp;rsquo;t
generate much feedback so disabling comments altogether is not really a problem.
I haven&amp;rsquo;t updated the site recently and here is why. The 0.6.x release of Jaws
is buggy and I still haven&amp;rsquo;t found anything else which fully meets my needs for
managing my own web content.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore for the last couple of months I have been working on an open source
CMS of my own called R3-born. More details to follow about that soon, but you
can find the project over at Sourceforge, don&amp;rsquo;t expect anything to work
(although it does for the most part) it is pre-alpha and unreleased. SVN is the
only way to snag the source.&lt;/p>

I finally notified the core &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/minerva/">Minerva&lt;/a>
developers that I am leaving the project. Given that I started the project a few
years back it was not a decision I made lightly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have a couple of reasons for leaving the project, the main one being that I
just do not have the time available to effectively lead or contribute to the
project. All open source projects require good leadership and I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able
to provide that for most of 2005. It is with the best interests of Minerva in
mind that I decided to leave.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, Minerva is in very good hands and is under active development,
with Dave and Chris leading the effort. I wish all the Minerva developers and
users every success with the upcoming release of R4, it is a marvelous
achievement and I am sure will prove to be very successful. I will be
keeping an eye on R4 development, and if time permits, I may contribute some
blocks and modules in the future. Until then, good luck and make me proud!&lt;/p></description><summary>Standing down from the Minerva project</summary></item><item><title>Introducing Stanley, a new theme for Jaws</title><link>https://wimpysworld.com/posts/introducing-stanley-a-new-theme-for-jaws/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Aug 2005 09:29:53 +0000</pubDate><author>martin@wimpress.com (Martin Wimpress)</author><guid>https://wimpysworld.com/posts/introducing-stanley-a-new-theme-for-jaws/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve finished hacking together a new theme for &lt;a href="http://jaws-project.com/">Jaws&lt;/a>
0.5.x, which I have named Stanley, and is now the default theme on this site.
I&amp;rsquo;ve still got to fix a couple of bugs and make sure that it is compatible with
browsers other than Firefox. I wanted a theme which was crisp and clean, but
also fully compatible with Jaws, so I decided to blend some of my favourite
themes together. Stanley is inspired by the Kubrick theme which is popular among
bloggers and although the Kubrick graphics have been borrowed the style sheet
and layout are derived from the &lt;code>jaws&lt;/code>, &lt;code>orange-grey&lt;/code> and &lt;code>simple-green&lt;/code>
themes which are bundled with Jaws. As a result Stanley is properly Jaws
