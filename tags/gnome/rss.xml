During these trips, it became apparent that my laptop is not the right tool for the job.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At &lt;a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/archive/2022/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/">KubeCon EU 2022&lt;/a> my colleague Lindsay brought her &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/macbook-pro-13/">Apple Macbook Pro M1&lt;/a>. It was lightweight, compact, looked fabulous and had epic battery life. Meanwhile, my ThinkPad P1 Gen 1 looked fabulous but is a bit of a chonker and a massive power pig 🔌🐖 Battery anxiety was constant that week and also on my subsequent trips to &lt;a href="https://www.sreday.com/">SREday 2022&lt;/a> and the &lt;a href="https://events.canonical.com/event/2/">Ubuntu Summit 2022&lt;/a>. Sensing that 2022 wasn&amp;rsquo;t an outlier and more travel would be on the cards in 2023 I decided that I wanted some of that thin and light laptop action. So, with all that in mind, in early December 2022, I went hunting for a Linux laptop and this is my journey.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="as-featured-on-linux-matters-">As featured on Linux Matters! 🎙️&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I recently discussed my hunt for a new Linux Loving Laptop on the &lt;a href="https://linuxmatters.sh/">Linux Matters&lt;/a> podcast. &lt;strong>You can hear that discussion with my friends Alan and Mark on &lt;a href="https://linuxmatters.sh/1/">Linux Matters: Mastodon on My Résumé (Episode 1)&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="past-laptop-purchasing-mistakes-">Past laptop purchasing mistakes 😱&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Those that fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it&amp;rdquo; - Winston Churchill.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The requirements for my last two laptop purchases were very different from what I need today; a &lt;a href="https://www.dell.com/en-uk/shop/laptop-computers-2-in-1-pcs/precision-5550-mobile-workstation/spd/precision-15-5550-laptop">Dell XPS 15 5550&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadp/thinkpad-p1/22ws2wpp101">ThinkPad P1 Gen1&lt;/a> Both have significant power requirements with 15.6&amp;quot; UHD displays and discrete NVIDIA GPUs. The ThinkPad P1 Gen also sports a Xeon CPU ⚡️ These made sense when I bought them, I was travelling one week every month and regularly compiling large applications, building container images, VMs and operating system images. These days I have a &lt;a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-threadripper-3970x">Threadripper 3970X&lt;/a> workstation at home that I can connect to via &lt;a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale&lt;/a> to run compute-intensive tasks. I simply don&amp;rsquo;t need a workhorse 🐴 laptop anymore.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="laptop-criteria-">Laptop criteria 📑&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m deeply impressed with the outstanding work the &lt;a href="https://asahilinux.org/">Asahi Linux&lt;/a> team are doing to enable Linux on Apple Silicon Macs, but running Linux on an M1 Mac isn&amp;rsquo;t viable for me as some hardware support (HDMI for example) is still a work in progress. Not ideal when you&amp;rsquo;re a conference speaker and running booth demos.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are my criteria for the new laptop. Some must-haves, some nice-to-haves and some hard exclusions.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Fully Linux compatible.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Linux pre-installed to demonstrate Linux is fully supported&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Full working day battery life; ~8 hours in my opinion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Low-power CPU, 35W or under
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Ideally AMD 6000 series but a 12th Gen Intel as a compromise&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No 11th Gen Intel or AMD 5000 series CPUs will be considered&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>64GB RAM, will compromise on 32GB RAM&lt;/li>
&lt;li>13&amp;quot; or 14&amp;quot; 1920x1200 matte display
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>No UHD resolutions display will be considered (for power-saving reasons)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Touch support is a nice-to-have, but not essential&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1920x1080 as a compromise, but nothing lower&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No discrete GPU. Again for power-saving reasons.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>USB-C charging&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dual NVME SSD, or at least a single 2TB (or more) SSD&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Decent keyboard and touchpad&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Laptop should weigh close to 1kg&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Premium build quality and design (somewhat subjective I know)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>With this list of requirements established, I &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kaB1pxbbYa1ebxeDRTguQ9EZol1EhM-0FE45Da8AOn8/edit#gid=0">started collating Linux laptop comparison notes in this somewhat idiosyncratic spreadsheet&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p class="text-center">
&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kaB1pxbbYa1ebxeDRTguQ9EZol1EhM-0FE45Da8AOn8/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">&lt;img src="./spreadsheet.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="Linux Laptop Comparison Spreadsheet"/>&lt;/a>
&lt;br />
&lt;em>A spreadsheet that probably only makes sense to me &lt;/em>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Looking at the list of laptops in the sheet above, you might be wondering why I didn&amp;rsquo;t consider any laptops from the established dedicated Linux laptop vendors such as &lt;a href="https://www.entroware.com/store/">Entroware&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://slimbook.es/">Slimbook&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://starlabs.systems/">StarLabs&lt;/a>. Well, I did look at everything they offered at the time and none of them had a model available that met the requirements I&amp;rsquo;ve outlined above or the estimated dispatch time was nearly half a year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not going to elaborate on the rationale behind ruling certain laptop models in or out, but I will say this; I was very impressed to see &lt;a href="http://lenovo.com/linux">&lt;strong>every laptop in the Lenovo ThinkPad lineup had a Linux pre-install option&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> of either &lt;a href="https://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://getfedora.org/">Fedora&lt;/a> in &amp;ldquo;Build YourPC&amp;rdquo; system configurator. While comparing the power requirements of Intel&amp;rsquo;s i7-12xx series and AMD&amp;rsquo;s 68x0 series CPU at the time, I was sold on the impressive battery endurance of AMD&amp;rsquo;s offerings and the superior integrated graphics, so I excluded any laptop with Intel CPUs quite early on.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="lenovo-thinkpad-z13-gen-1-with-ubuntu-pre-installed">Lenovo ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1 with Ubuntu pre-installed&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I went with the &lt;a href="https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadz/thinkpad-z13-(13-inch-amd)/21d2cto1wwgb1">ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1&lt;/a> with Ubuntu pre-installed, and the &lt;a href="https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadt/thinkpad-t14s-gen-3-(14-inch-amd)/len101t0015">ThinkPad T14s Gen 3&lt;/a> was runner-up in my selection process.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="specifications-">Specifications 📝&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The key specifications for the laptop I ordered are AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 6850U CPU, 32 GB LPDDR5-6400MHz (Soldered), 1 TB SSD M.2 2242 PCIe Gen4, 13.3&amp;quot; WUXGA (1920 x 1200), IPS, Anti-Glare, Non-Touch display weighing in at 1.19kg. I think this configuration hits the sweet spot for battery endurance, more on that later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of the increasing trend of soldering RAM on motherboards, but that was common across all the models of laptops I was considering. If &lt;a href="https://frame.work/gb/en">Framework&lt;/a> had offered an AMD 6000 series CPU option at the time, I would&amp;rsquo;ve had a Framework laptop on my short list as the modular design of the Framework laptops is very appealing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And yes, I did make a compromise with the laptop specifications; that 1TB M.2 SSD is below my minimum requirement of 2TB. I did do my homework though and will present my creative upgrade solution in a future blog post. &lt;a href="https://wimpysworld.com/posts/rss.xml">Like and Subscribe&lt;/a> 😉&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="build-quality--design-">Build Quality &amp;amp; Design 💻️&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Without a doubt, the ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1 is a gorgeous laptop. I do not have enough superlatives to express just how much I love it. It is, in my option, it is an almost flawless design. Exactly the compact form factor laptop I was seeking; it&amp;rsquo;s beautiful to look at from any angle and a delight to use. Here are some highlights.&lt;/p>
&lt;p class="text-center">
&lt;img src="./ThinkPad_Z13_Gen_1_CT1_02.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1"/>
&lt;br />
&lt;em>ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1&lt;/em>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The laptop is engineered from 75% recycled aluminium and 95% recycled plastics, then boxed in 100% renewable, compostable packaging. The touchpad is sublime and amazingly 120mm wide on the compact laptop. The haptic touch is simply excellent. The touchpad is the most Macbook-like touchpad I&amp;rsquo;ve used on any PC and it is so good it has caused me to change what desktop environment I now use. More on this in a future blog post. However, there is currently no Linux software to &lt;a href="https://psref.lenovo.com/syspool/Sys/PDF/datasheet/ThinkPad_Z_Series_Haptic_TouchPad_Settings.pdf">configure the haptic touchpad settings&lt;/a> such as click force and touchpad feedback intensity but I&amp;rsquo;ve been perfectly happy with the defaults. If you do dual boot Windows the haptic settings configured via Windows are stored on the device and carry over to Linux.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Keyboard is an excellent low-profile design, each key has ~1.2mm of travel which is the same as the actuation point on my Razer Huntsman V2 TKL keyboards with opto-mechanical switches. Most importantly the Fn&lt;/kbd> key is in the correct place on the Z13 and not where ThinkPads have been incorrectly plonking it for years. Fight me! 🥊 If you are a long-time ThinkPad owner, it is likely you&amp;rsquo;ll hate the idea of the keyboard and touchpad on the Z13 since it is quite a departure from the traditional design. But I went into this with my eyes 👀 open and have watched and read many reviews.&lt;/p>
&lt;p class="text-center">
&lt;img src="./ThinkPad_Z13_Gen_1_CT4_01.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="Correct Fn key placement on ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1"/>
&lt;br />
&lt;em>"This is the way"&lt;/em>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Display is bright (400nits), anti-reflective and anti-smudge, covers 100% of the sRGB colour gamut and the laptop is perfectly balanced so it can be opened one-handed. I&amp;rsquo;m embracing the compact, thin and light lifestyle. So the two USB-C ports are fine with me as I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen a laptop configuration with excellent battery endurance (more on that in a bit) and plan to use completely untethered most of the time, only having cables and adapters plugged in for very specific tasks and overnight recharging.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do have one niggle though; there is an unusable 2242 M.2 slot on the motherboard. It is only intended for use with select models of WWAN cards, none of which are a configuration option for the UK models of the Z13. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like the antenna is wired in either, so even if you do get a supported WWAN card aftermarket it is unlikely to work well; if at all. I can share my iPhone&amp;rsquo;s mobile service via Wifi, so not a deal breaker in that regard but it is rather annoying to have an M.2 slot on the motherboard and nothing I can do with it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="ubuntu-pre-install-experience-">Ubuntu pre-install experience 👌&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It is worth noting that at the time of purchase, selecting Ubuntu or Fedora in the system configuration on the Lenovo website applied a £155 discount! 🤑 Choosing Ubuntu or Fedora across the ThinkPad line applies a discount, although the amount varies based on the model.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All OEMs that partner with Ubuntu get an OEM designation for each device officially endorsed and supported by Canonical. The ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1 is known as &lt;em>Sutton Newell Abe&lt;/em> and the &lt;code>oem-sutton.newell-abe-meta&lt;/code> package (along with the assosicate OEM PPA) provides the device-specific hardware enablement and power management tuning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p class="text-center">
&lt;img src="./oem-name.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1 (Sutton Newell Abe)"/>
&lt;br />
&lt;em>ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1 is known as Sutton Newell Abe for OEM enablement&lt;/em>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The OEM image of Ubuntu differs from the standard Ubuntu image in a few ways. The most obvious is that OEM image comes with recovery media creation pre-installed. This is a great feature and I highly recommend you use it to create a recovery USB stick, either during the initial setup or post-setup. The OEM image also comes with Chromium and Firefox installed, as opposed to just Firefox in the downloadable release of Ubuntu. IIRC, this is because Chromium has traditionally worked better with touchscreen laptops.
The fingerprint works. I was able to set it up and use it to authenticate logging in via GDM. But the biometrics support does extend throughout the system. Ubuntu Software doesn&amp;rsquo;t integrate with the fingerprint reader, neither does &lt;code>snapd&lt;/code> or any other privilege escalation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also experience the touchpad becoming unresponsive, requiring and click to &amp;ldquo;unfreeze&amp;rdquo; it. This happens quite frequently and detracts from what is otherwise an excellent, class-leading, touchpad. Both these issues with the fingerprint reader and touchpad are Ubuntu-specific and nothing related to the actual hardware. Both issues are absent when running NixOS. I suspect it is overly aggressive power management settings in the OEM image, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t investigate beyond that hunch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having a tier-1 vendor such as Lenovo ship a laptop with Ubuntu pre-installed has the benefit of great firmware support. I&amp;rsquo;ve received several firmware updates since I got the laptop, and they have all applied without issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p class="text-center">
&lt;img src="./firmware-update.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1 firmware updates on Ubuntu"/>
&lt;br />
&lt;em>Firmware updates for the ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1 on Ubuntu 20.04&lt;/em>
&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="why-not-ubuntu-2204-">Why not Ubuntu 22.04? 🤔&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>My Z13 was shipped with Ubuntu 20.04.4 with OEM optimised Linux kernel 5.14.0-1054-oem. Some might be perplexed (or annoyed) that it didn&amp;rsquo;t come with Ubuntu 22.04, given it was ordered in late 2022. I used to work for Canonical, and during that time worked with Lenovo to enable Ubuntu on ~60 of their laptops and workstations between 2019 and 2021, so I do have some insight into how this process works. It simply boils down to how the factory image certification process works, and once an image is qualified that is what ships on the device for the duration of its availability. Re-certification adds cost and takes time, so it&amp;rsquo;s extremely rare for a device to have a revised factory image qualified once it has gone on sale.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Upgrading to Ubuntu 22.04 LTS worked flawlessly, full audio support was restored and no other hardware supported regressed. Brilliant.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="linux-kernel-61-">Linux Kernel 6.1 🌰&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The pre-installed Ubuntu and Fedora images for the Z13 come with kernels that have backported patches applied to fully support the device. If you buy a ThinkPad Z13 and plan to run another Linux distro on it, make sure you can install Linux kernel version 6.1 or newer. This is to ensure the Qualcomm Wi-Fi 6E NFA725A 2x2 AX chipset is fully supported and that the required patches to properly suspend and resume are available.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="battery-endurance-">Battery endurance 🔋&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This is, after all, my most important selection criteria. The conclusion here is simple: &lt;strong>11 hours&lt;/strong> ⏱️&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is 11 hours of mixed-use. Coding in Visual Studio Code. Chatting in Slack and Discord. Video calls in Google Meet and Zoom. Compiling software. Some screen capture with OBS Studio and basic video editing with Shotcut. Closing the lid of the laptop and leaving it suspended for 24 hours depletes the battery by ~4% which is about 2 Wh. Very respectable. I haven&amp;rsquo;t felt the need to profile power use or tweak anything, I get plenty of untethered compute time. I&amp;rsquo;m very happy with the battery life, typically charging the laptop overnight while I sleep and running it all day battery only.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="whats-next-">What&amp;rsquo;s next? 🔮&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As noted, I did compromise on the 1TB M.2 SSD. I&amp;rsquo;ve come up with an aftermarket solution to upgrade to 2TB which I will post about soon. I chose a laptop pre-installed with Linux for two reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Support companies shipping Linux operating system pre-installed on their laptops and workstations&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hard proof Linux works on their hardware&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>After using Ubuntu for a few weeks I switched to NixOS. I will be posting about my experience with NixOS on the Z13 in a future blog post and &lt;a href="https://twitch.tv/WimpysWorld">will likely livestream about it on Twitch&lt;/a> as well. TL;DR NixOS 22.11 has fewer issues than Ubuntu 22.04 on the ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1 is an excellent laptop for my requirements, and I have no regrets. If I were to buy I laptop pre-installed with a Linux distro in the future, I might go for Fedora, just so I can see what the OEM experience is like with Fedora.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since I purchased the Z13, &lt;a href="https://frame.work/gb/en/blog/framework-laptop-13-with-13th-gen-intel-core-and-amd-ryzen-7040-series">Framework has announced AMD 7040-series powered laptops&lt;/a> are coming later in 2023; and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I can resist&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description><summary>Picking a thin and light Linux laptop with plenty of battery endurance</summary></item><item><title>Retro Home</title><link>https://wimpysworld.com/projects/retro-home/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>martin@wimpress.com (Martin Wimpress)</author><guid>https://wimpysworld.com/projects/retro-home/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/wimpysworld/retro-home">Retro Home&lt;/a> is custom Raspberry Pi

&lt;strong>Note&lt;/strong> Updated on June 3rd 2014 and now includes LXQt and Unity.
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>For the last 9 months or so I&amp;rsquo;ve spent my spare time working with the
&lt;a href="http://mate-desktop.org">MATE Desktop Team&lt;/a>. Every so often, via the various
on-line MATE communities, the topic of how &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;light weight&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em> MATE is when
compared to other desktop environments crops up and quite often
&lt;a href="http://www.xfce.org/">Xfce&lt;/a> is suggested as a lighter alternative. After all
MATE and Xfce both provide a traditional desktop environment based on GTK+ so
this suggestion is sensible. But is Xfce actually &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;lighter&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em> than MATE?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve found MATE to be (subjectively) more responsive that Xfce and there have
been two recent blog posts that indicate MATE has lower memory requirements than
Xfce.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://l3net.wordpress.com/2013/12/17/four-lightweight-desktops-for-opensuse-13-1/">Four Lightweight Desktops for openSUSE 13.1&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://l3net.wordpress.com/2014/02/15/a-memory-comparison-of-light-linux-desktops-part-3/">A Memory Comparison of Light Linux Desktops – Part 3&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Given that I&amp;rsquo;m comfortably running MATE on the Raspberry Pi Model B (which has
just 512MB RAM) I&amp;rsquo;ve been stating that MATE is well suited for use on resource
constrained hardware and professional workstations alike. This is still true,
but I&amp;rsquo;ve also said that MATE is lighter than Xfce and I might have to eat humble
pie on that one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The topic of measursing desktop environment resource use came up on the
&lt;code>#archlinux-tu&lt;/code> IRC channel recently and someone suggested using
&lt;a href="https://github.com/pixelb/ps_mem/">ps_mem.py&lt;/a> to gather the memory usage data.
&lt;code>ps_mem.py&lt;/code> provides a far more robust mechanism for gathering memory usage data
than I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in previous comparisons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So the seed was planted, I created a bunch of VirtualBox guest machines and set
to work comparing the memory requirements of all the Linux desktop environments
I could.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="damn-it-just-tell-me-what-the-lightest-desktop-environment-is">Damn it, just tell me what the &amp;ldquo;&lt;em>lightest&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo; desktop environment is!&lt;/h2>

explanation, here it is:&lt;/p>

but if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have one then &lt;code>lightdm&lt;/code> was chosen. LXDE, Xfce, MATE, Cinnamon
and GNOME all have &lt;code>gvfs-smb&lt;/code> installed as this enables accessing Windows and
Samba shares (a common requirement for home and office) in their respective file
managers and the KDE install includes packages to provide equivalent functionality.
You can see the specific desktop environment packages or package groups that were
installed here:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/flexiondotorg/ArchInstaller/tree/master/packages/desktop">https://github.com/flexiondotorg/ArchInstaller/tree/master/packages/desktop&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Each VM was booted, logged in and any initial desktop environment configuration
was completed choosing the default options if prompted. Then &lt;code>ps_mem&lt;/code> was
installed, the VM shut down and a snapshot made.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each VM was then started, logged in via the display manager, the desktop
environment was fully loaded and waited for disk activity to settle. Then
&lt;code>ps -efH&lt;/code> and &lt;code>ps_mem&lt;/code> were executed via SSH and the results sent back to my
workstation. When the process and memory collections were conducted there had
been no desktop interaction and no applications had been launched.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="your-numbers-are-wrong-i-can-get-xxx-desktop-to-run-in-yyy-less-memory">Your numbers are wrong I can get &lt;em>xxx&lt;/em> desktop to run in &lt;em>yyy&lt;/em> less memory!&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Well done, you probably can.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each virtual machine has VirtualBox guest additions, OpenSSH, Network Manager,
&lt;code>avahi-daemon&lt;/code>, &lt;code>ntpd&lt;/code>, &lt;code>rpc.statd&lt;/code>, &lt;code>syslog-ng&lt;/code> and various other bits and bobs
installed and running. Some of these are not required or have lighter alternatives
available.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, while I freely accept that each desktop environment can be run in less memory,
the results here are relative to a consistent base setup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, what is important to note is that &lt;strong>I think the Cinnamon results are
too low&lt;/strong>. Cinnamon is forked from GNOME3 and the Arch Linux package groups for
Cinnamon only install the core Cinnamon packages but none of the GNOME3
applications or components that would be required to create a full desktop
environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So comparing Cinnamon with the other desktops in this test is not a fair
comparison. For example, GNOME3 and KDE default installs on Arch Linux include
all the accessibility extensions and applications for sight or mobility impaired
individuals where as Cinnamon does not. This is just one example of where I
think the Cinnamon results are skewed.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-ram-is-there-to-be-used-is-lighter-actually-better">The RAM is there to be used. Is lighter actually better?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>No, and Yes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I subscribe to the school of thought that RAM is there to be used. But;&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I want to preserve as much free RAM for the applications I run, not for feature bloat in the desktop environment. I&amp;rsquo;m looking at you KDE.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I want a fully integrated desktop experience, but not one that is merely lighter because it lacks features. I&amp;rsquo;m looking at you LXDE.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I want a consistent user interface that any of my family could use, not one that favours style over substance. I&amp;rsquo;m looking at you Enlightenment.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Another take on lightness is that the more RAM used, the more code that needs
executing. Therefore, higher CPU utilisation and degraded desktop performance
on modest hardware. This could also translate into degraded battery performance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is why I choose MATE Desktop. It is a fully integrated desktop environment,
that is responsive, feature full, has reasonable memory requirements and scales
from single core armv6h CPU with 512MB RAM to multi core x86_64 CPU with 32GB
RAM (for me at least).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="without-the-full-stats-it-never-happened-prove-it">Without the full stats it never happened. Prove it!&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>He is the full data capture from &lt;code>ps_mem.py&lt;/code> for each desktop environment.&lt;/p>

my preferred GNOME 3 setup on my netbook, laptops and workstations. The main
features are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Quickly deploys Arch Linux to my specifications&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Supports i686 and x64_64.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Detects ATI/AMD, Intel and Nvidia chipsets and configures the Open Source video drivers and enables early KMS.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hardware and location aware. Installation and configuration can be different for Home vs Work or Desktop vs Netbook.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Detects and correctly configures some device specific hardware, such as touch screens and wireless drivers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Automatically configures DAEMONS array.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Includes custom power management hooks for pm-utils.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Designed to safely run multiple times so that it can be used as a tool for keeping all systems consistent.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve dubbed this script Arch Angel. I&amp;rsquo;m undecided if I&amp;rsquo;ll release it publicly
since it is very much my personal preferences and to some extent my colleagues
at work. I suppose the real reason for this post is that I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to

Oneiric 11.10. We&amp;rsquo;ve agreed to hate each other. A few weeks ago I started using
&lt;a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME 3&lt;/a> and it only took me a couple of hours to
adapt to it&amp;rsquo;s workflow. GNOME 3 is now my desktop environment at home and and
work. I love it! If you&amp;rsquo;d like to give GNOME 3 a whirl then you could try
installing Jan Hoffman&amp;rsquo;s Ubuntu GNOME Shell Remix from either the 32-bit or
64-bit ISOs he has prepared. This will give a &amp;ldquo;pure&amp;rdquo; GNOME 3 experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://ubuntu-gs-remix.sourceforge.net/p/home/">http://ubuntu-gs-remix.sourceforge.net/p/home/&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If you already have Ubuntu 11.10 installed then you can install GNOME 3 alongside
Unity. Here are the incantations you&amp;rsquo;ll need to utter in a shell.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo apt-add-repository ppa:jan-hoffmann/gnome-shell
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo apt-add-repository ppa:aegirxx-googlemail/gnome-shell-extensions
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo apt-add-repository ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo apt-add-repository ppa:webupd8team/gnome3
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo apt-get update
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-bin gnome-core gnome-documents gnome-shell gnome-sushi gnome-tweak-tool gnomeshell-default-settings gtk3-engines-unico
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The repositories added above will give you access to Jan&amp;rsquo;s GNOME 3 meta
packages, updated GNOME 3 packages and some extra GNOME 3 extensions. GNOME 3
extensions add all manner of additional tweaks and functionality. Some
extensions can even provide a user experience more akin to that of GNOME 2.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://intgat.tigress.co.uk/rmy/extensions/index.html">http://intgat.tigress.co.uk/rmy/extensions/index.html&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In order to get acquainted with GNOME 3 I suggest you read the
&lt;a href="http://www.gnome.org/gnome-3/">Discover GNOME 3&lt;/a> (watch the videos too) and
&lt;a href="http://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell/CheatSheet">GNOME 3 Cheat Sheet&lt;/a> pages. Having
read those you&amp;rsquo;ll soon master GNOME 3. After you&amp;rsquo;ve used GNOME 3 for a while you
may conclude it is a more usable desktop environment than Unity, which isn&amp;rsquo;t a
surprising conclusion to arrive at given Unity sucks the big one right now. If
you want a &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;pure&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em> GNOME 3 experience then the following commands will purge
Unity and other bits and bobs that GNOME 3 simply doesn&amp;rsquo;t require.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="remove-unity">Remove Unity&lt;/h2>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo apt-purge unity unity-2d unity-2d-launcher unity-asset-pool unity-common &lt;span style="color:#87ceeb">\
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#87ceeb">&lt;/span>unity-greeter unity-lens-applications unity-lens-music libunity-misc4
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="remove-overlay-scrollbars">Remove Overlay Scrollbars&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>These just don&amp;rsquo;t work on my netbook since they regularly obscure portions of
the window I actually want to click on. The can safely be removed even if you
intend to continue using Unity.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo apt-get purge overlay-scrollbar liboverlay-scrollbar-0.2-0 liboverlay-scrollbar3-0.2-0
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="remove-indicators">Remove Indicators&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you never going back to Unity, Indicators can be safely removed.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo apt-get purge xchat-gnome-indicator indicator-appmenu indicator-power &lt;span style="color:#87ceeb">\

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#87ceeb">&lt;/span>libindicator-messages-status-provider1
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="remove-global-menu">Remove Global Menu&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Again, Global Menu is not used by GNOME 3. So if you not going back to Unity
these can be safely removed.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo apt-get purge appmenu-gtk3 appmenu-gtk appmenu-qt firefox-globalmenu &lt;span style="color:#87ceeb">\
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#87ceeb">&lt;/span>thunderbird-globalmenu
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Finally, a word or warning: &lt;strong>Distribution upgrades are not possible!&lt;/strong> You
can&amp;rsquo;t upgrade to a newer version of Ubuntu when using Jan Hoffman&amp;rsquo;s Ubuntu
GNOME Shell Remix or if you modify an existing Ubuntu 11.10 using my method
above. You will have to do a full install once the next Ubuntu release is
available. This can&amp;rsquo;t be fixed as long as Jan&amp;rsquo;s meta packages are unofficial,
because the distribution upgrade process requires having installed one of the
desktop meta packages from the official Ubuntu repositories.&lt;/p></description><summary>Creating a pure GNOME 3 experience on Ubuntu 11.10</summary></item><item><title>Shotwell 0.11 PPA available for Ubuntu Lucid and Maverick</title><link>https://wimpysworld.com/posts/shotwell-0.11-ppa-available-for-ubuntu-lucid-and-maverick/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Aug 2011 11:05:50 +0000</pubDate><author>martin@wimpress.com (Martin Wimpress)</author><guid>https://wimpysworld.com/posts/shotwell-0.11-ppa-available-for-ubuntu-lucid-and-maverick/</guid><description>&lt;p>Like many others I wanted &lt;a href="http://yorba.org/shotwell/">Shotwell&lt;/a> 0.11

&lt;a href="http://yorba.org/shotwell/">Shotwell&lt;/a>. Shotwell is a photo organiser
for &lt;a href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME&lt;/a> that I&amp;rsquo;ve been testing for a few
months now but the recent 0.5 release which added tagging and printing,
it means Shotwell is finally ready replace &lt;a href="http://f-spot.org">F-Spot&lt;/a> on
my workstation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Shotwell is intuitive, well documented, extremely easy to use and reliable.
It&amp;rsquo;s easy to dismiss Shotwell as an over simplified photo manager. But once
you start using it, you&amp;rsquo;ll quickly appreciate its clean interface and
easy-to-use tools. Don&amp;rsquo;t just take my word for it either, Shotwell is now the
default photo manager in &lt;a href="http://fedoraproject.org">Fedora&lt;/a> 13 alpha. Here is
a quick run down of the features.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Import photos from folders or from any digital camera supported by gPhoto.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shotwell automatically groups photos taken at the same time. You can also
use tags to organize your photo collection.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can rotate, crop, reduce red-eye, and adjust the exposure, saturation,
tint, and temperature of each photo.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Publish photos to Facebook, Flickr and Picasa Web Albums.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Shotwell provides a non-destructive way to tweak your photos. Instead of
modifying the original photos, Shotwell stores all edits in a database and
applies them on-the-fly as necessary. This means that you can easily undo all
edits. Shotwell comes equipped with all the usual photo enhancing tools and
slideshow. You can download a source tarball from the Shotwell home page at
&lt;a href="http://www.yorba.org/shotwell/">http://www.yorba.org/shotwell/&lt;/a> or grab a binary for Ubuntu Karmic or Lucid
via Yorba&amp;rsquo;s Launchpad PPA.&lt;/p>

I have tested a
couple of blog clients and have settled on &lt;a href="http://blogtk.sourceforge.net/">BloGTK&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It has a simple user interface but comprehensive features, although I did need
to define a few Custom Tags before the editor supported all the formatting
options I wanted. Setting up BloGTK is very simple for Ubuntu and Debain users
requiring an &lt;code>aptitude install blogtk&lt;/code> to get it installed and the following
settings will connect to a Wordpress blog.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Server URL: &lt;code>http://blog.example.org/xmlrpc.php&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Account: &lt;em>Your Username&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Password: &lt;em>Your Password&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Blogging System: &lt;em>Moveable Type&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Now I can blog directly from my desktop, I am hoping it will encourage me to
post more often.&lt;/p></description><summary>Graphical blogging client for GNOME</summary></item><item><title>Ubuntu</title><link>https://wimpysworld.com/projects/ubuntu/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>martin@wimpress.com (Martin Wimpress)</author><guid>https://wimpysworld.com/projects/ubuntu/</guid><description>&lt;p>Ubuntu comes with everything you need to run your organisation, school, home or
