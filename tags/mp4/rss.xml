access at home for a month. Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m online again and I have been tinkering
with various projects the most recent of which is Matroska conversion (again).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="matroska-to-mp4">Matroska to MP4&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For sometime I have been converting Martoska files to MPEG-4 with AAC 5.1 audio
so I can stream them via Mediatomb to my PlayStation 3. The conversion process
works well although there is some overhead in transcoding the audio and the
AAC 5.1 audio is not as good quality as the original AC3 or DTS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are interested I&amp;rsquo;ve put my code in GitHub, the script automates the
whole process.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/flexiondotorg/MKV-to-MP4">MPV-to-MP4&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="matroska-to-m2ts">Matroska to M2TS&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A little while back I read it was possible to convert those same Matroska file
to M2TS files which, so long as the audio is AC3, so takes much less time to
convert. As the PlayStation 3 can&amp;rsquo;t play DTS audio streams inside a M2TS container
there is still a requirement to transcode DTS to AC3. That said the conversion to
M2TS requires less file I/O than converting to MPEG-4 and is therefore it is
generally a quicker conversion method, typically just 2 or 3 minutes on my
workstation at home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plus the audio quality of the AC3 or transcoded DTS is better than that of
transcoded AAC 5.1. I&amp;rsquo;ve created my own script to fully automate the conversion
process. The script has been tested on Ubuntu 8.10 64-bit but there is an
outside chance it will work on Mac OS X if you can get the required tools
installed. Again, you can find my script on GitHub.&lt;/p>

with a nice web user interface, it allows you to stream your digital media
through your home network and listen to/watch it on a variety of UPnP
compatible devices, such as the PlayStation in my case.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mediatomb 0.12 is not yet released as final yet but it is certainly stable
enough for general use, so I spent the last week migrating from Mediatomb 0.11
to Mediatomb 0.12.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently finished ripping my entire CD collection (344 CDs) to MP3 and I
am currently ripping my DVD collection (85 done so far) to MP4 with AAC 5.1
audio. The &amp;lsquo;Music&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Video&amp;rsquo; folders in our home directories are mounted via
NFS. The Mediatomb server uses the same data sources so any playlists or new
music/videos we might import are immediately reflected in Mediatomb.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our entire CD library is now available at the click of a button, automatically
organised by genre, artist and date. We have also created some playlists
in &lt;code>.m3u&lt;/code> or &lt;code>.pls&lt;/code> format.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>New to Mediatomb 0.12 is the ability to scrobble your music to
&lt;a href="http://www.last.fm">Last.fm&lt;/a>, this a killer feature for me and why I chose to
migrate to 0.12 before it goes final.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I ripped the CDs using &lt;a href="http://www.burtonini.com/blog/computers/sound-juicer">SoundJuicer&lt;/a>,
since I can configure it to use &lt;a href="http://lame.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/lame/lame/doc/html/presets.html">LAME presets&lt;/a>.
I then used the &lt;a href="http://musicbrainz.org/doc/PicardTagger">Music Brainz Picard Tagger&lt;/a> to
add additional tagging and embed cover art and then applied ReplayGain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally my wife and I use &lt;a href="http://banshee-project.org/">Banshee&lt;/a> to manage the
music library on our computers, including the creation of playlists and syncing
to our iPods.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am using &lt;a href="http://handbrake.fr/">Handbrake&lt;/a> to rip the DVDs to MP4. I&amp;rsquo;ve created a
new PS3 compatible profile which is focused on quality, I&amp;rsquo;ll post details
about that in the future. Mediatomb 0.12 has some experimental features to
stream video content from .ISO images of DVDs. I&amp;rsquo;ve yet to play with that but
it sounds very cool. I&amp;rsquo;ve also created a script which queries IMDB to
categorise our film library by genre and create summary information about
each film in the library. I&amp;rsquo;ll be posting more about that soon. I haven&amp;rsquo;t
finalised how we will integrate Photo management with Mediatomb yet, but that
is that final piece in the puzzle.&lt;/p></description><summary>In home streaming via UPnP with Mediatomb</summary></item></channel></rss>
