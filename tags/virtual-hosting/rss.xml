with Debian and Ubuntu and these HOW-TOs have been sent to the RavenCore
developer to help document the outstanding incompatibilities.&lt;/p></description><summary>Updated Debian &amp;amp; Ubuntu documentation for RavenCore</summary></item><item><title>RavenCore 0.1.5 on Debian</title><link>https://wimpysworld.com/posts/ravencore-0.1.5-on-debian/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Apr 2006 19:18:15 +0000</pubDate><author>martin@wimpress.com (Martin Wimpress)</author><guid>https://wimpysworld.com/posts/ravencore-0.1.5-on-debian/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have updated my HOW-TO for installing &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ravencore/">RavenCore&lt;/a>

very responsive to my feedback and has significantly improved &amp;ldquo;out of the box&amp;rdquo;
Debian compatibility in this release. The are still some minor compatibility
issues and I&amp;rsquo;ve&amp;rsquo; sent feedback to the developer in the hope that things will
continue to improve with RavenCore 0.1.6.&lt;/p></description><summary>New RavenCore.

so that managing my domains and e-mail accounts for friends and family will be
as easy as possible. RavenCore is designed for use on CentOS primarily and
therefore RavenCore 0.1.4 requires some tweaking in order to get it fully
working and compatible with Debian.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have been sharing my feedback with the RavenCore author and when RavenCore
0.1.5 is released &amp;ldquo;out of the box&amp;rdquo; Debian compatibility should be a reality.&lt;/p></description><summary>Managing virtual hosting on Debian with RavenCore</summary></item><item><title>RavenCore 0.0.6 on Debian</title><link>https://wimpysworld.com/posts/ravencore-0.0.6-on-debian/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jan 2006 11:24:41 +0000</pubDate><author>martin@wimpress.com (Martin Wimpress)</author><guid>https://wimpysworld.com/posts/ravencore-0.0.6-on-debian/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have been testing a few virtual hosting control panels the last couple of
days and I am deeply impressed with &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ravencore/">RavenCore&lt;/a>,
so much so I will most likely use it for a project I am planning. However,
Debian is my server distro of choice and RavenCore needs a little tweaking in
order to work seamlessly with Debian. I have been keeping some notes that
explain how to get RavenCore to play nicely with Debian.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have submitted my notes in the RavenCore Forums and agreed to assist the
author with any future testing to work toward better &amp;ldquo;out of the box&amp;rdquo; Debian
integration.&lt;/p></description><summary>Virtual hosting on Debian with RavenCore</summary></item></channel></rss>
