neglect. The first thing to do was move away from &lt;a href="http://jaws-project.com/">Jaws&lt;/a>.
Sadly, my Jaws installation is broken in a way that newer Jaws releases refuse
to upgrade it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did some research and decided to migrate to &lt;a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress&lt;/a>
since it caters for all the essentials I require either in the core
functionality or via plugins. Plus I can integrate with some other stuff I want
to use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The migration to Wordpress was made all the easier thanks to the excellent &lt;a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4184">Jaws import plugin&lt;/a>
I found on the Wordpress trac. However, I decided not to use the Textile plugin
to preserve the Jaws formatted text. Instead I chose to manually clean up some
of the old entries so I could stick with the TinyMCE editor long term.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am happy with Wordpress thus far and look forward to getting some plugins
going and picking up a new theme over the coming days and weeks.&lt;/p></description><summary>Jaws dropped in a move to Wordpress</summary></item><item><title>Comments off, Overdue update and R3-born</title><link>https://wimpysworld.com/posts/comments-off-overdue-update-and-r3-born/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jul 2006 13:14:55 +0000</pubDate><author>martin@wimpress.com (Martin Wimpress)</author><guid>https://wimpysworld.com/posts/comments-off-overdue-update-and-r3-born/</guid><description>&lt;p>First of all, I have disabled comments on my blog. &lt;a href="http://jaws-project.com/">Jaws&lt;/a>
has spam protection and captachs but both implementations suck. This site doesn&amp;rsquo;t
generate much feedback so disabling comments altogether is not really a problem.
I haven&amp;rsquo;t updated the site recently and here is why. The 0.6.x release of Jaws
is buggy and I still haven&amp;rsquo;t found anything else which fully meets my needs for
managing my own web content.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore for the last couple of months I have been working on an open source
CMS of my own called R3-born. More details to follow about that soon, but you
can find the project over at Sourceforge, don&amp;rsquo;t expect anything to work
(although it does for the most part) it is pre-alpha and unreleased. SVN is the
only way to snag the source.&lt;/p>

0.5.x, which I have named Stanley, and is now the default theme on this site.
I&amp;rsquo;ve still got to fix a couple of bugs and make sure that it is compatible with
browsers other than Firefox. I wanted a theme which was crisp and clean, but
also fully compatible with Jaws, so I decided to blend some of my favourite
themes together. Stanley is inspired by the Kubrick theme which is popular among
bloggers and although the Kubrick graphics have been borrowed the style sheet
and layout are derived from the &lt;code>jaws&lt;/code>, &lt;code>orange-grey&lt;/code> and &lt;code>simple-green&lt;/code>
themes which are bundled with Jaws. As a result Stanley is properly Jaws
compatible, in that left and right layouts work, all the CSS elements are
supported and CSS tweaks are used throughout to improve the visual appeal.&lt;/p></description><summary>A new theme for Jaws called Stanley</summary></item><item><title>Basic site layout complete</title><link>https://wimpysworld.com/posts/basic-site-layout-complete/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Aug 2005 09:27:44 +0000</pubDate><author>martin@wimpress.com (Martin Wimpress)</author><guid>https://wimpysworld.com/posts/basic-site-layout-complete/</guid><description>&lt;p>After fiddling around with the &lt;a href="http://jaws-project.com/">Jaws&lt;/a> setup for a while
I have finally settled on something which I&amp;rsquo;m happy with. Once I found the
&lt;code>default_page&lt;/code> setting in the registry I was very happy. I&amp;rsquo;ll enable more
gadgets (plugins) as I find a use for them, but my next task will probably be
creating my own theme or at least combining ideas from several existing themes.&lt;/p></description><summary>Website look and feel with Jaws</summary></item><item><title>Grrr, a site with teeth</title><link>https://wimpysworld.com/posts/grrr-a-site-with-teeth/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Aug 2005 09:10:10 +0000</pubDate><author>martin@wimpress.com (Martin Wimpress)</author><guid>https://wimpysworld.com/posts/grrr-a-site-with-teeth/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well, I have decided to get Flexion.Org on-line again and picked &lt;a href="http://jaws-project.com/">Jaws&lt;/a>
as the tool for the job. This might seem an odd choice considering I have been
working on Minerva for the last 3 years, but there you are, life is strange.&lt;/p></description><summary>Rebooting Flexion.Org using Jaws</summary></item></channel></rss>
