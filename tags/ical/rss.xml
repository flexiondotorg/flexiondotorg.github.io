wife I and to use. You see, like most men I have no idea when and where I am
supposed to be. This is because my wife keeps all this information in her
filofax and that lives in her handbag, somewhere I never venture. So I have
spent this evening setting up &lt;a href="http://phpicalendar.net/">PHP iCalendar&lt;/a> on
&lt;a href="http://www.lighttpd.net/">Lighttpd&lt;/a>, and I am very happy with the results.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have opted to use the &lt;code>publish.php&lt;/code> add-on provided with PHP iCalendar, rather
than add the WebDAV module to Lighty. For our modest requirements it works
very well. We now have full read/write access to our calendar by using the
&lt;a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/">Lightning&lt;/a> extension for
Thunderbird and read only access via the PHP iCalendar web interface. Viewing
the calendar via the web interface requires a login first and the calendar
publishing is protected by Lighty authentication using htdigest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lastly, because our calendar is a nice open standard I have options as to how I
might sync it with my mobile phone. More on that when I figure it out.&lt;/p></description><summary>Creating a self-hosted shared calendar</summary></item></channel></rss>
