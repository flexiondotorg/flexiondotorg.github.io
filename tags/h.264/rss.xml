user to select one audio stream and one subtitle stream. Optionally the video
can be requantised, using M2VRequantiser and an ISO image created. If creating
an ISO image the chapters are also preserved from the original DVD. You can
see the original post below.&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve just released an update to that original script which fixes subtitles in
the original MPEG-2 PS mode but now adds the capability to rip MPEG-2 TS. The
video stream can still be shrunk and in MPEG-2 PS mode the video is still
requantised but in MPEG-2 TS mode the video is re-encoded as H.264.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Requantising is faster but can introduce artifacting. H.264 encoding is
slower, but produces very good quality. I am currently re-importing my entire
DVD collection, using this script, to my DLNA server using MPEG-2 TS and
re-encoding the video to H.264. This gives me high quality rips at relatively
small size (~3Gb) whilst preserving Dolby Digital 5.1 audio. Perfect for
playback via DLNA on the PS3. Some things to be aware of:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Subtitles are only supported in MPEG-2 PS mode.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>MPEG-2 PS files created by this script are DVD compliant.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ISO files created by this script will preserve the chapters from the original DVD.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The PS3 can only play DTS audio in MPEG-2 PS streams when they have been authored to DVD.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The PS3 can only play subtitles in MPEG-2 PS streams when they have been authored to DVD.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The PS3 can&amp;rsquo;t play DTS audio in MPEG-2 TS streams therefore this script will transcode DTS to AC3 when in MPEG-2 TS mode.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>To download the script and find out how to make full use of it visit the
release page below.&lt;/p>

Therefore I&amp;rsquo;ve written a script that
creates a PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 compatible MPEG-4 from Matroska providing
the video is H.264 and audio is AC3 or DTS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Xbox 360 compatibility requires that audio is forcibly downmixed to stereo
with &lt;code>--stereo&lt;/code>. AAC 5.1 audio will have the correct channel assignments when
transcoding from AC3 5.1 and DTS 5.1. If &lt;code>neroAacEnc&lt;/code> is installed then it is
used in preference to &lt;code>faac&lt;/code> for encoding the AAC audio, as it produces better
quality output. &lt;code>neroAacEnc&lt;/code> is optional.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The script does as little re-encoding as possible, only the audio and
subtitles are re-encoded or converted. The script can detect profile 5.1 H.264
and patch it to 4.1 in under a second. Any subtitles in the Matroska are
preserved. If &lt;code>mp4creator&lt;/code> is used the subtitles are extracted stored in a
seperate file. If &lt;code>MP4Box&lt;/code> is used (default) the subtitles are converted to
GPAC Timed Text and muxed into the resulting MPEG-4. The PlayStation 3 can&amp;rsquo;t
display these subtitles but some software players can.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The script can optionally split the Matroska if it is greater than 4GB to ensure
PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and FAT32 compatibility. This script works on Ubuntu and
should work on any other Linux/Unix flavour and possibly Mac OS X providing you
have the required tools installed.&lt;/p>
