looking for an alternative, on and off, over that last few weeks. Ideally I
would have liked a portable music player that supported Ogg Vorbis but as my
home cinema isn&amp;rsquo;t Ogg Vorbis compatible I decided to standardize on MP3. No
flames please!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have lots of MMC and SD memory cards that I have collected over the years so
decided get a player which could make use of them. I only need a player for use
in the gym and while cycling so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to be too fancy, with that in
mind I decided to get the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sumvision-Snowfox-XT105-Portable-Playback/dp/B000F9TD1S">Sumvision XT105 MP3 Player&lt;/a>
which is super cheap and surprisingly good considering the price &lt;code>:-)&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Initial impressions are that the manual was obviously translated from Chinese to
English using Google, the included headphones are not much cop. That said,
once you plug-in a decent set of head phones the sound reproduction is very good
and more than good enough for what I want it for and although playlists aren&amp;rsquo;t
supported playback by folder is. That player is very light and very small, so
ideal for use in the gym and battery life is around 10-12 hours from a single
AAA battery. It is also Linux compatible, although I have been using a USB
card reader to populate my memory cards with MP3s as the XT105 is only USB 1.1
and therefore a bit slow. I am off to the gym now with some banging tunes.&lt;/p></description><summary>Cheap as chips MP3 player upgrade</summary></item></channel></rss>
