&lt;em>Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders&lt;/em> for the first time in years! ScummVM
allows you to run certain classic graphical point-and-click adventure games,
provided you already have their data files, allowing you to play them on
systems for which they were never designed!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, I decided to organise my old adventure games for use with ScummVM so that I
can enjoy them all again, but this has led to a couple of eBay bids to buy some
games I am missing. I have used the ScummVM tools to compress as the game data
files so I can fit the games on my iPAQ 4150. Life is good. I have been thinking
of getting a new solid state Ogg Vorbis compatible portable music player but
haven&amp;rsquo;t found one which completely suits my needs. So, my iPAQ 4150 is now
standing in as my portable music player too. This is thanks too the excellent
GSPlayer. I have configured my iPAQ 4150 to be a full time entertainment device.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am off to get myself a decent set of head phones today, more on that later&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description><summary>Using an iPAQ 4150 PocketPC for games &amp;amp; music</summary></item></channel></rss>
