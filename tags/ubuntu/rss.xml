During these trips, it became apparent that my laptop is not the right tool for the job.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At &lt;a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/archive/2022/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/">KubeCon EU 2022&lt;/a> my colleague Lindsay brought her &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/macbook-pro-13/">Apple Macbook Pro M1&lt;/a>. It was lightweight, compact, looked fabulous and had epic battery life. Meanwhile, my ThinkPad P1 Gen 1 looked fabulous but is a bit of a chonker and a massive power pig 🔌🐖 Battery anxiety was constant that week and also on my subsequent trips to &lt;a href="https://www.sreday.com/">SREday 2022&lt;/a> and the &lt;a href="https://events.canonical.com/event/2/">Ubuntu Summit 2022&lt;/a>. Sensing that 2022 wasn&amp;rsquo;t an outlier and more travel would be on the cards in 2023 I decided that I wanted some of that thin and light laptop action. So, with all that in mind, in early December 2022, I went hunting for a Linux laptop and this is my journey.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="as-featured-on-linux-matters-">As featured on Linux Matters! 🎙️&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I recently discussed my hunt for a new Linux Loving Laptop on the &lt;a href="https://linuxmatters.sh/">Linux Matters&lt;/a> podcast. &lt;strong>You can hear that discussion with my friends Alan and Mark on &lt;a href="https://linuxmatters.sh/1/">Linux Matters: Mastodon on My Résumé (Episode 1)&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="past-laptop-purchasing-mistakes-">Past laptop purchasing mistakes 😱&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Those that fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it&amp;rdquo; - Winston Churchill.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The requirements for my last two laptop purchases were very different from what I need today; a &lt;a href="https://www.dell.com/en-uk/shop/laptop-computers-2-in-1-pcs/precision-5550-mobile-workstation/spd/precision-15-5550-laptop">Dell XPS 15 5550&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadp/thinkpad-p1/22ws2wpp101">ThinkPad P1 Gen1&lt;/a> Both have significant power requirements with 15.6&amp;quot; UHD displays and discrete NVIDIA GPUs. The ThinkPad P1 Gen also sports a Xeon CPU ⚡️ These made sense when I bought them, I was travelling one week every month and regularly compiling large applications, building container images, VMs and operating system images. These days I have a &lt;a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-threadripper-3970x">Threadripper 3970X&lt;/a> workstation at home that I can connect to via &lt;a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale&lt;/a> to run compute-intensive tasks. I simply don&amp;rsquo;t need a workhorse 🐴 laptop anymore.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="laptop-criteria-">Laptop criteria 📑&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m deeply impressed with the outstanding work the &lt;a href="https://asahilinux.org/">Asahi Linux&lt;/a> team are doing to enable Linux on Apple Silicon Macs, but running Linux on an M1 Mac isn&amp;rsquo;t viable for me as some hardware support (HDMI for example) is still a work in progress. Not ideal when you&amp;rsquo;re a conference speaker and running booth demos.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are my criteria for the new laptop. Some must-haves, some nice-to-haves and some hard exclusions.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Fully Linux compatible.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Linux pre-installed to demonstrate Linux is fully supported&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Full working day battery life; ~8 hours in my opinion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Low-power CPU, 35W or under
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Ideally AMD 6000 series but a 12th Gen Intel as a compromise&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No 11th Gen Intel or AMD 5000 series CPUs will be considered&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>64GB RAM, will compromise on 32GB RAM&lt;/li>
&lt;li>13&amp;quot; or 14&amp;quot; 1920x1200 matte display
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>No UHD resolutions display will be considered (for power-saving reasons)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Touch support is a nice-to-have, but not essential&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1920x1080 as a compromise, but nothing lower&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No discrete GPU. Again for power-saving reasons.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>USB-C charging&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dual NVME SSD, or at least a single 2TB (or more) SSD&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Decent keyboard and touchpad&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Laptop should weigh close to 1kg&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Premium build quality and design (somewhat subjective I know)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>With this list of requirements established, I &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kaB1pxbbYa1ebxeDRTguQ9EZol1EhM-0FE45Da8AOn8/edit#gid=0">started collating Linux laptop comparison notes in this somewhat idiosyncratic spreadsheet&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p class="text-center">
&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kaB1pxbbYa1ebxeDRTguQ9EZol1EhM-0FE45Da8AOn8/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">&lt;img src="./spreadsheet.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="Linux Laptop Comparison Spreadsheet"/>&lt;/a>
&lt;br />
&lt;em>A spreadsheet that probably only makes sense to me &lt;/em>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Looking at the list of laptops in the sheet above, you might be wondering why I didn&amp;rsquo;t consider any laptops from the established dedicated Linux laptop vendors such as &lt;a href="https://www.entroware.com/store/">Entroware&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://slimbook.es/">Slimbook&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://starlabs.systems/">StarLabs&lt;/a>. Well, I did look at everything they offered at the time and none of them had a model available that met the requirements I&amp;rsquo;ve outlined above or the estimated dispatch time was nearly half a year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not going to elaborate on the rationale behind ruling certain laptop models in or out, but I will say this; I was very impressed to see &lt;a href="http://lenovo.com/linux">&lt;strong>every laptop in the Lenovo ThinkPad lineup had a Linux pre-install option&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> of either &lt;a href="https://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://getfedora.org/">Fedora&lt;/a> in &amp;ldquo;Build YourPC&amp;rdquo; system configurator. While comparing the power requirements of Intel&amp;rsquo;s i7-12xx series and AMD&amp;rsquo;s 68x0 series CPU at the time, I was sold on the impressive battery endurance of AMD&amp;rsquo;s offerings and the superior integrated graphics, so I excluded any laptop with Intel CPUs quite early on.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="lenovo-thinkpad-z13-gen-1-with-ubuntu-pre-installed">Lenovo ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1 with Ubuntu pre-installed&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I went with the &lt;a href="https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadz/thinkpad-z13-(13-inch-amd)/21d2cto1wwgb1">ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1&lt;/a> with Ubuntu pre-installed, and the &lt;a href="https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadt/thinkpad-t14s-gen-3-(14-inch-amd)/len101t0015">ThinkPad T14s Gen 3&lt;/a> was runner-up in my selection process.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="specifications-">Specifications 📝&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The key specifications for the laptop I ordered are AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 6850U CPU, 32 GB LPDDR5-6400MHz (Soldered), 1 TB SSD M.2 2242 PCIe Gen4, 13.3&amp;quot; WUXGA (1920 x 1200), IPS, Anti-Glare, Non-Touch display weighing in at 1.19kg. I think this configuration hits the sweet spot for battery endurance, more on that later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of the increasing trend of soldering RAM on motherboards, but that was common across all the models of laptops I was considering. If &lt;a href="https://frame.work/gb/en">Framework&lt;/a> had offered an AMD 6000 series CPU option at the time, I would&amp;rsquo;ve had a Framework laptop on my short list as the modular design of the Framework laptops is very appealing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And yes, I did make a compromise with the laptop specifications; that 1TB M.2 SSD is below my minimum requirement of 2TB. I did do my homework though and will present my creative upgrade solution in a future blog post. &lt;a href="https://wimpysworld.com/posts/rss.xml">Like and Subscribe&lt;/a> 😉&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="build-quality--design-">Build Quality &amp;amp; Design 💻️&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Without a doubt, the ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1 is a gorgeous laptop. I do not have enough superlatives to express just how much I love it. It is, in my option, it is an almost flawless design. Exactly the compact form factor laptop I was seeking; it&amp;rsquo;s beautiful to look at from any angle and a delight to use. Here are some highlights.&lt;/p>
&lt;p class="text-center">
&lt;img src="./ThinkPad_Z13_Gen_1_CT1_02.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1"/>
&lt;br />
&lt;em>ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1&lt;/em>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The laptop is engineered from 75% recycled aluminium and 95% recycled plastics, then boxed in 100% renewable, compostable packaging. The touchpad is sublime and amazingly 120mm wide on the compact laptop. The haptic touch is simply excellent. The touchpad is the most Macbook-like touchpad I&amp;rsquo;ve used on any PC and it is so good it has caused me to change what desktop environment I now use. More on this in a future blog post. However, there is currently no Linux software to &lt;a href="https://psref.lenovo.com/syspool/Sys/PDF/datasheet/ThinkPad_Z_Series_Haptic_TouchPad_Settings.pdf">configure the haptic touchpad settings&lt;/a> such as click force and touchpad feedback intensity but I&amp;rsquo;ve been perfectly happy with the defaults. If you do dual boot Windows the haptic settings configured via Windows are stored on the device and carry over to Linux.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Keyboard is an excellent low-profile design, each key has ~1.2mm of travel which is the same as the actuation point on my Razer Huntsman V2 TKL keyboards with opto-mechanical switches. Most importantly the Fn&lt;/kbd> key is in the correct place on the Z13 and not where ThinkPads have been incorrectly plonking it for years. Fight me! 🥊 If you are a long-time ThinkPad owner, it is likely you&amp;rsquo;ll hate the idea of the keyboard and touchpad on the Z13 since it is quite a departure from the traditional design. But I went into this with my eyes 👀 open and have watched and read many reviews.&lt;/p>
&lt;p class="text-center">
&lt;img src="./ThinkPad_Z13_Gen_1_CT4_01.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="Correct Fn key placement on ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1"/>
&lt;br />
&lt;em>"This is the way"&lt;/em>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Display is bright (400nits), anti-reflective and anti-smudge, covers 100% of the sRGB colour gamut and the laptop is perfectly balanced so it can be opened one-handed. I&amp;rsquo;m embracing the compact, thin and light lifestyle. So the two USB-C ports are fine with me as I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen a laptop configuration with excellent battery endurance (more on that in a bit) and plan to use completely untethered most of the time, only having cables and adapters plugged in for very specific tasks and overnight recharging.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do have one niggle though; there is an unusable 2242 M.2 slot on the motherboard. It is only intended for use with select models of WWAN cards, none of which are a configuration option for the UK models of the Z13. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like the antenna is wired in either, so even if you do get a supported WWAN card aftermarket it is unlikely to work well; if at all. I can share my iPhone&amp;rsquo;s mobile service via Wifi, so not a deal breaker in that regard but it is rather annoying to have an M.2 slot on the motherboard and nothing I can do with it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="ubuntu-pre-install-experience-">Ubuntu pre-install experience 👌&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It is worth noting that at the time of purchase, selecting Ubuntu or Fedora in the system configuration on the Lenovo website applied a £155 discount! 🤑 Choosing Ubuntu or Fedora across the ThinkPad line applies a discount, although the amount varies based on the model.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All OEMs that partner with Ubuntu get an OEM designation for each device officially endorsed and supported by Canonical. The ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1 is known as &lt;em>Sutton Newell Abe&lt;/em> and the &lt;code>oem-sutton.newell-abe-meta&lt;/code> package (along with the assosicate OEM PPA) provides the device-specific hardware enablement and power management tuning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p class="text-center">
&lt;img src="./oem-name.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1 (Sutton Newell Abe)"/>
&lt;br />
&lt;em>ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1 is known as Sutton Newell Abe for OEM enablement&lt;/em>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The OEM image of Ubuntu differs from the standard Ubuntu image in a few ways. The most obvious is that OEM image comes with recovery media creation pre-installed. This is a great feature and I highly recommend you use it to create a recovery USB stick, either during the initial setup or post-setup. The OEM image also comes with Chromium and Firefox installed, as opposed to just Firefox in the downloadable release of Ubuntu. IIRC, this is because Chromium has traditionally worked better with touchscreen laptops.
The fingerprint works. I was able to set it up and use it to authenticate logging in via GDM. But the biometrics support does extend throughout the system. Ubuntu Software doesn&amp;rsquo;t integrate with the fingerprint reader, neither does &lt;code>snapd&lt;/code> or any other privilege escalation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also experience the touchpad becoming unresponsive, requiring and click to &amp;ldquo;unfreeze&amp;rdquo; it. This happens quite frequently and detracts from what is otherwise an excellent, class-leading, touchpad. Both these issues with the fingerprint reader and touchpad are Ubuntu-specific and nothing related to the actual hardware. Both issues are absent when running NixOS. I suspect it is overly aggressive power management settings in the OEM image, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t investigate beyond that hunch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having a tier-1 vendor such as Lenovo ship a laptop with Ubuntu pre-installed has the benefit of great firmware support. I&amp;rsquo;ve received several firmware updates since I got the laptop, and they have all applied without issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p class="text-center">
&lt;img src="./firmware-update.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1 firmware updates on Ubuntu"/>
&lt;br />
&lt;em>Firmware updates for the ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1 on Ubuntu 20.04&lt;/em>
&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="why-not-ubuntu-2204-">Why not Ubuntu 22.04? 🤔&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>My Z13 was shipped with Ubuntu 20.04.4 with OEM optimised Linux kernel 5.14.0-1054-oem. Some might be perplexed or annoyed that it didn&amp;rsquo;t come with Ubuntu 22.04, given it was ordered in late 2023. I used to work for Canonical, and during that time worked with Lenovo to enable Ubuntu on ~60 of their laptops and workstations between 2019 and 2021, so I do have some insight into how this process works. It simply boils down to how the factory image certification process works, and once an image is qualified that is what ships on the device for the duration of its availability. Re-certification adds cost and takes time, so it&amp;rsquo;s extremely rare for a device to have a revised factory image qualified once it has gone on sale.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Upgrading to Ubuntu 22.04 LTS worked flawlessly, full audio support was restored and no other hardware supported regressed. Brilliant.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="linux-kernel-61-">Linux Kernel 6.1 🌰&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The pre-installed Ubuntu and Fedora images for the Z13 come with kernels that have backported patches applied to fully support the device. If you buy a ThinkPad Z13 and plan to run another Linux distro on it, make sure you can install Linux kernel version 6.1 or newer. This is to ensure the Qualcomm Wi-Fi 6E NFA725A 2x2 AX chipset is fully supported and that the required patches to properly suspend and resume are available.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="battery-endurance-">Battery endurance 🔋&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This is, after all, my most important selection criteria. The conclusion here is simple: &lt;strong>11 hours&lt;/strong> ⏱️&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is 11 hours of mixed-use. Coding in Visual Studio Code. Chatting in Slack and Discord. Video calls in Google Meet and Zoom. Compiling software. Some screen capture with OBS Studio and basic video editing with Shotcut. Closing the lid of the laptop and leaving it suspended for 24 hours depletes the battery by ~4% which is about 2 Wh. Very respectable. I haven&amp;rsquo;t felt the need to profile power use or tweak anything, I get plenty of untethered compute time. I&amp;rsquo;m very happy with the battery life, typically charging the laptop overnight while I sleep and running it all day battery only.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="whats-next-">What&amp;rsquo;s next? 🔮&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As noted, I did compromise on the 1TB M.2 SSD. I&amp;rsquo;ve come up with an aftermarket solution to upgrade to 2TB which I will post about soon. I chose a laptop pre-installed with Linux for two reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Support companies shipping Linux operating system pre-installed on their laptops and workstations&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hard proof Linux works on their hardware&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>After using Ubuntu for a few weeks I switched to NixOS. I will be posting about my experience with NixOS on the Z13 in a future blog post and &lt;a href="https://twitch.tv/WimpysWorld">will likely livestream about it on Twitch&lt;/a> as well. TL;DR NixOS 22.11 has fewer issues than Ubuntu 22.04 on the ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1 is an excellent laptop for my requirements, and I have no regrets. If I were to buy I laptop pre-installed with a Linux distro in the future, I might go for Fedora, just so I can see what the OEM experience is like with Fedora.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since I purchased the Z13, &lt;a href="https://frame.work/gb/en/blog/framework-laptop-13-with-13th-gen-intel-core-and-amd-ryzen-7040-series">Framework has announced AMD 7040-series powered laptops&lt;/a> are coming later in 2023; and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I can resist&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description><summary>Picking a thin and light Linux laptop with plenty of battery endurance</summary></item><item><title>machinespawn</title><link>https://wimpysworld.com/projects/machinespawn/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>martin@wimpress.com (Martin Wimpress)</author><guid>https://wimpysworld.com/projects/machinespawn/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/wimpysworld/machinespawn">machinespawn&lt;/a> is a wrapper for

When
it came to setting it up I ran into a problem, I only had Raspberry Pi 3
computers available and at the time of writing the microSDHC card
provided with the Nextcloud Box only supports the Raspberry Pi 2. &lt;em>Bummer!&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="overview">Overview&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>This guide outlines how to use &lt;a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/core">Ubuntu Core&lt;/a>
on the &lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi 3&lt;/a> to run &lt;a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud&lt;/a>
provided as a &lt;a href="http://snapcraft.io">snap&lt;/a> from the Ubuntu store.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with Ubuntu Core, here&amp;rsquo;s a quote:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Ubuntu Core is a tiny, transactional version of Ubuntu for IoT devices and large container deployments. It runs a new breed of super-secure, remotely upgradeable Linux app packages known as snaps&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>After following this guide Ubuntu Core and any installed snaps (and
their data) will reside on the SD card and the 1TB hard disk in the
Nextcloud box will be available for file storage. This
guide explains how to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Install and configure Ubuntu Core 16 for the Raspberry Pi 3&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Format the 1TB hard disk in the Nextcloud Box and auto-mount it&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Install the Nextcloud snap and connect the &lt;code>removable-media&lt;/code> interface to allow access to the hard disk&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Activate and configure the Nextcloud &lt;em>External Storage&lt;/em> app so the hard disk can be used to store files&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Optional configuration of Email and HTTPS for Nextcloud&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

follow the &lt;a href="https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/snappy/start/raspberry-pi-2/">Get started with a Raspberry Pi 2 or 3&lt;/a>
page as it fully explains how to use a desktop computer to download an
Ubuntu Core image for your Raspberry Pi 2 or 3 and copy it to an SD card
ready to boot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s how to create an Ubuntu Core microSDHC card for the Raspberry Pi
3 using an Ubuntu desktop:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Download &lt;a href="http://releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-core/16/ubuntu-core-16-pi3.img.xz">Ubuntu Core 16 image for Raspberry Pi 3&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Insert the microSDHC card into your PC
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Use &lt;a href="apt://gnome-disk-utility">GNOME Disks&lt;/a> and its &lt;em>Restore Disk Image&amp;hellip;&lt;/em> option, which &lt;strong>natively supports XZ compressed images.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Select your SD card from the panel on the left&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Click the &amp;ldquo;burger menu&amp;rdquo; on the right and Select &lt;em>Restore Disk Image&amp;hellip;&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Making sure the SD card is still selected, click the Power icon on the right.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Eject the SD card physically from your PC.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;div class="text-center">&lt;img src="GNOME-Disks-Restore-Disk-Image.png" class="img-fluid" alt="GNOME Disks - Restore Disk Image" />&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="ubuntu-core-first-boot">Ubuntu Core first boot&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>An Ubuntu SSO account is required to setup the first user on Ubuntu Core:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Start by creating an &lt;a href="https://login.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu SSO account&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Import an &lt;a href="https://login.ubuntu.com/ssh-keys">SSH Key into your Ubuntu SSO account&lt;/a>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Here are &lt;a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys">instructions to generate an SSH Key&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;ll need a keyboard and monitor connected to the Raspberry Pi 3 to go complete the first boot process and device configuration.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Insert the Ubuntu Core microSHDC into the Raspberry Pi, which should be
in the &lt;a href="https://nextcloud.com/wp-content/themes/next/assets/files/Box-Assembly-Guide.pdf?x16328">assembled Nextcloud Box&lt;/a>
with a keyboard and monitor connected. Plug in the power.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The system will boot then become ready to configure&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The device will display the prompt &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Press enter to configure&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Press enter then select &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Start&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em> to begin configuring your network and an administrator account. Follow the instructions on the screen, you will be asked to configure your network and enter your Ubuntu SSO credentials&lt;/li>
&lt;li>At the end of the process, you will see your credentials to access your Ubuntu Core machine:&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>This device is registered to &amp;lt;Ubuntu SSO email address&amp;gt;.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Remote access was enabled via authentication with the SSO user &amp;lt;Ubuntu SSO user name&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Public SSH keys were added to the device for remote access.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h3 id="login">Login&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Once setup is done, you can login to Ubuntu Core using ssh, from a
computer on the same network, using the following command:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>ssh &amp;lt;Ubuntu SSO user name&amp;gt;@&amp;lt;device IP address&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The user name is your Ubuntu SSO user name.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="reconfiguring-network">Reconfiguring network&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Should you need to reconfigure the network at a later stage you can do
so with:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo console-conf
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="prepare-1tb-hard-disk">Prepare 1TB hard disk&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Log in to your Raspberry Pi 3 running Ubuntu Core via ssh.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>ssh &amp;lt;Ubuntu SSO user name&amp;gt;@&amp;lt;device IP address&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h3 id="partition-and-format-the-nextcloud-box-hard-disk">Partition and format the Nextcloud Box hard disk&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This will create a single partition formatted with the ext4 filesystem.&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Do the following to create the partition:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Command (m for help): o

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Command (m for help): n
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Partition type

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> e extended (container for logical partitions)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Select (default p): p
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Partition number (1-4, default 1): 1
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>First sector (2048-1953458175, default 2048):
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Last sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G,T,P} (2048-1953458175, default 1953458175):
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Created a new partition 1 of type &amp;#39;Linux&amp;#39; and of size 931.5 GiB.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Command (m for help): w
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Now format the partition and give it the label &lt;strong>data&lt;/strong>. This label will
be used to reference it for mounting later:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo mkfs.ext4 -L data /dev/sda1
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h3 id="automatically-mount-the-partition">Automatically mount the partition&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Most of the Ubuntu Core root file system is read-only, so it is not
possible to edit &lt;code>/etc/fstab&lt;/code>. Therefore we&amp;rsquo;ll use &lt;a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/">systemd&lt;/a>
to achieve that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Be aware of one of the &lt;code>systemd.mount&lt;/code> pitfalls:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Mount units must be named after the mount point directories they control. Example: the mount point /home/lennart must be configured in a unit file home-lennart.mount.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Yes that&amp;rsquo;s right! &lt;strong>The unit filename must match the mount point path&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Create the &lt;code>media-data.mount&lt;/code> unit:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo vi /writable/system-data/etc/systemd/system/media-data.mount
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Add the following content:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-systemd" data-lang="systemd">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#f00">[Unit]&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Description=&lt;span style="color:#87ceeb">Mount unit for data&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#f00">[Mount]&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>What=&lt;span style="color:#87ceeb">/dev/disk/by-label/data&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Where=&lt;span style="color:#87ceeb">/media/data&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Type=&lt;span style="color:#87ceeb">ext4&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#f00">[Install]&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>WantedBy=&lt;span style="color:#87ceeb">multi-user.target&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Reload systemd, scanning for new or changed units:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo systemctl daemon-reload
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Start the &lt;code>media-data.mount&lt;/code> unit, which will mount the volume, and also
enable it so it will be automatically mounted on boot.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo systemctl start media-data.mount
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo systemctl enable media-data.mount
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>And just like any other unit, you can view its status using
&lt;code>systemctl status&lt;/code>:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo systemctl status media-data.mount
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="update-ubuntu-core">Update Ubuntu Core&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Make sure Ubuntu Core is up-to-date and reboot.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo snap refresh
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo reboot
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>After the reboot, make sure &lt;code>/media/data&lt;/code> is mounted. If not double
check the steps above.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="install-nextcloud">Install Nextcloud&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Nextcloud snap uses the &lt;code>removable-media&lt;/code> interface, which grants
access to &lt;code>/media/*&lt;/code>, and requires manual connection:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo snap install nextcloud
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo snap connect nextcloud:removable-media core:removable-media
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Browse to the Nextcloud IP address and create the admin user account,
for example:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://nextcloud.local/">http://nextcloud.local/&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="nextcloud-configuration">Nextcloud configuration&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the examples below replace &lt;code>nextcloud.local&lt;/code> with the IP address or
hostname of your Nextcloud Box and replace &lt;code>example.org&lt;/code> with your domain.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="external-storage">External Storage&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Enable the External Storge app via:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://nextcloud.local/index.php/settings/apps?category=disabled#">http://nextcloud.local/index.php/settings/apps?category=disabled#&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Configure External Storage app via:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://nextcloud.local/index.php/settings/admin/externalstorages">http://nextcloud.local/index.php/settings/admin/externalstorages&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Use these settings:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Folder name: &lt;em>data&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>External storage: &lt;em>Local&lt;/em>&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="email">Email&lt;/h3>

&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://nextcloud.local/index.php/settings/admin/additional">http://nextcloud.local/index.php/settings/admin/additional&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I use &lt;a href="https://sendgrid.com/">Sendgrid&lt;/a> for sending email alerts from my
servers and devices. These are the settings that work for me:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Send mode: &lt;em>SMTP&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Encryption: &lt;em>STARTTLS&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>From address: &lt;em>&lt;a href="mailto:nextcloud@example.org">nextcloud@example.org&lt;/a>&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Authentication method: &lt;em>Plain&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Authentication required: &lt;em>Yes&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Server address: &lt;em>smtp.sendgrid.net:587&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Username: &lt;code>apikey&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Password: &lt;code>theactualapikey&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="enabling-https">Enabling HTTPS&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It is strongly recommend that you use HTTPS if you intend to expose your
Nextcloud to the Internet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First do a test to see if you can install a Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt certificate:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo nextcloud.enable-https -d
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Answer the questions:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Have you met these requirements? (y/n) y
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Please enter an email address (for urgent notices or key recovery): name@example.org
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Please enter your domain name(s) (space-separated): nextcloud.example.org
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Attempting to obtain certificates... done
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Looks like you&amp;#39;re ready for HTTPS!
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>If everything went well, then install the certificate&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo nextcloud.enable-https
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Answer the questions again:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Have you met these requirements? (y/n) y
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Please enter an email address (for urgent notices or key recovery): name@example.org
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Please enter your domain name(s) (space-separated): nextcloud.example.org
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Attempting to obtain certificates... done
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Restarting apache... done
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>If Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt didn&amp;rsquo;t work for you, you can always use Nextcloud with
a self-signed certificate.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo nextcloud.enable-https -s
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h3 id="manual-configuration-changes">Manual configuration changes&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If you need to make any tweaks to the Nextcloud configuration file you
can edit it like so:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo vi /var/snap/nextcloud/current/nextcloud/config/config.php
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>If you have manually edited the Nextcloud configuration you may need to
restart nextcloud:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo snap disable nextcloud
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo snap enable nextcloud
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>So there it is, Nextcloud running on Ubuntu Core powered by a Raspberry
Pi 3. The performance is reasonable, obviously not stellar, but certainly
good enough to move some cloud services for a small family away from the
likes of Google and Dropbox. Now go and install some

&lt;li>802.11a/b/g/n/ac WiFi&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Everything works out of the box with Ubuntu MATE 15.10 including sending
audio to the monitor over HDMI and DisplayPort.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-ram">The RAM&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="http://ark.intel.com/products/84993/Intel-Core-i7-5557U-Processor-4M-Cache-up-to-3_40-GHz">Core i7 5557U&lt;/a>
specs state that DDR3L 1866 Mhz RAM is supported. The arstechnica
&lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/03/mini-review-intels-powered-up-core-i7-broadwell-mini-pc/">Mini-review: Intel’s powered-up Core i7 Broadwell mini PC&lt;/a>
has some benchmarks that show a performance improvement when using 1866
Mhz clocked RAM, so I purchased:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://www.hyperxgaming.com/us/memory/impact">HyperX Impact SODIMM - 16GB Kit*(2x8GB) - DDR3L 1866MHz CL11 SODIMM&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="the-ssds">The SSDs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I have two SSDs in the NUC.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Samsung MZVPV256HDGL-00000 - SM951 256GB M.2 PCI-e 3.0 x 4 &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NVM_Express">NVMe&lt;/a> Solid State Drive&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.sandisk.co.uk/home/ssd/ultra-ii-ssd">SanDisk Ultra II SSD 960 GB Sata III 2.5-inch Internal SSD&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>This is where you might need to do some more research.&lt;/strong> At the
time of writing, it is not possible to boot directly from the Samsung
SM951 NVMe SSD. Although other quad channel NVMe SSDs do appear to be
supported as the boot device. It is possible that the &lt;a href="http://www.samsung.com/global/business/semiconductor/minisite/SSD/global/html/ssd950pro/overview.html">Samsung SSD 950 Pro&lt;/a>,
which is also NVMe, can be used as the boot device in Linux, but &lt;em>don&amp;rsquo;t
take my word for it&lt;/em>. Do your research.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My work around was make the SanDisk Ultra II the boot device by putting
&lt;code>/boot&lt;/code> and the MBR on it. I have put &lt;code>/&lt;/code> and &lt;code>swap&lt;/code> (swap because I
want to experiment with suspend and hibernate) are on the Samsung SM951
and &lt;code>/home&lt;/code> is on the SanDisk Ultra II.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are faster SSDs than the SanDisk Ultra II but this was 50% off
during Black Friday and just too good a deal to pass by. I did
sacrifice a little performance on this component, so if absolute
performance is your goal look at alternative SSDs, the &lt;a href="http://www.samsung.com/global/business/semiconductor/minisite/SSD/global/html/ssd850evo/overview.html">Samsung 850 EVO&lt;/a>
seems to benchmark favourably.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-monitor">The Monitor&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A week after I purchased the NUC I noticed &lt;a href="http://www.ebuyer.com/">ebuyer.com&lt;/a>
were selling the monitor I wanted with a £100 discount. So I snapped one up.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://www.samsung.com/uk/business/business-products/business-monitor/professional/LS27D85KTSN/XU">Samsung S27D850T&lt;/a> 27&amp;quot; WQHD LED DVI HDMI Monitor&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The NUC is connected via mini Display Port and my Dell Precision T7400
is connected via HDMI. The Samsung S27D850T has an audio out and a 2.1
speaker set is connected to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m extremely happy with the &lt;a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/nuc/nuc-kit-nuc5i7ryh.html">NUC5I7RYH&lt;/a>.
Linux compatibility is first class, it&amp;rsquo;s fast and has relatively low
power consumption. You can even charge a mobile phone using one of the
front USB ports (the yellow one) when the NUC is powered off. It is my
principle workstation and is able to handle everything I demand from it,
with ease:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>mp3 and ogg audio encoding&lt;/li>
&lt;li>h.264 video encoding (~1 min of video @480p encodes in 1 second)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>running multiple virtual machines&lt;/li>
&lt;li>compiling large applications&lt;/li>
&lt;li>creating xz compressed images of Ubuntu flavours for the Raspberry Pi 2&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve not tried gaming on it yet, but the holidays are approaching and
&lt;a href="http://www.gridgame.com/">GRID Autosport&lt;/a> was released for
&lt;a href="http://store.steampowered.com/steamos/">SteamOS&lt;/a> this week. So I know

that I&amp;rsquo;ve been using for a good while now. This blog post describes how to install
&lt;a href="http://getnikola.com/">Nikola&lt;/a> on Ubuntu 14.04 or newer. Now, this may look
like a long winded way to install Nikola, given that .deb package exists, but in
my opinion it is the correct way to install Nikola on Ubuntu.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="installing-python">Installing Python&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>First you&amp;rsquo;ll need Python.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo apt-get install cython3 libpython3.4 python3.4 python3.4-dev python3.4-minimal
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Now install the Python &amp;ldquo;package&amp;rdquo; management utilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo apt-get install python-setuptools python-virtualenv python-pip virtualenvwrapper
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="the-snakepit">The Snakepit&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Create a &amp;ldquo;Snakepit&amp;rdquo; directory for storing all the virtualenvs.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>mkdir ~/Snakepit
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="create-a-virtualenv-for-nikola">Create a virtualenv for Nikola&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The following will create a new virtualenv called &lt;code>nikola&lt;/code> based on Python 3.4.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.4 ~/Snakepit/nikola-773
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h3 id="working-on-a-virtualenv">Working on a virtualenv&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>To activate the virtualenv do the following.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>source ~/Snakepit/nikola-773/bin/activate
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Your shell prompt will change while a virtualenv is being worked on to indicate
which virtualenv is currently active.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While working on a virtualenv you can &lt;code>pip&lt;/code> install what you need or manually
install any Python libraries safe in the knowledge you will not adversely
damage any other virtualenvs or the global packages in the process. Very useful
for developing a new branch which may have different library requirements than
the master/head.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you are finished working in a virtualenv you can deactivate it by simply
executing &lt;code>deactivate&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="install-nikola-requirements">Install Nikola requirements&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Nikola requires some additional packages.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="install-nikola">Install Nikola&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>First install Cython, which will ensure some of the packages required by Nikola use
all the available optimisations.&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="create-a-site">Create a site&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>After installing Nikola, you should create a site. A site is a collection of
all assets needed to render your website, including configuration, posts,
pages, images, and all other files and customizations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To create a site, you need to run:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>nikola init &amp;lt;directory_name&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>A wizard will guide your initial setup The &lt;code>--demo&lt;/code> option can be used to populate
your site with some example content. If you do not want the wizard, use the &lt;code>--quiet&lt;/code>
argument.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nikola is now installed and and initial site is setup. &lt;code>nikola help&lt;/code> and the

&lt;h2 id="some-issues">Some Issues&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Here are some of the issues we noticed running Office 2010 under Wine.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Always install Office 2010 into it&amp;rsquo;s own &lt;code>WINEPREFIX&lt;/code>. You are less likely to run into problem that way.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Online updates do not work. Fortunately, the trial installer has SP1 integrated.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you purchase Office 2010 licenses you can still use the trial installer with your purchased license key(s).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We did test a trial of &lt;a href="http://www.codeweavers.com/">CrossOver&lt;/a>. However, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t activate Office 2010 on Arch Linux but did activate on Ubuntu.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Files saved to &lt;code>cifs&lt;/code> mounts are set read-only. This might be a Wine issue or due to the unusual way we have our file server configured, we are still investigating.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Should you ever need to, you can uninstall Office 2010 as follows.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It just is. Read the &lt;a href="http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/">virtualenv documentation&lt;/a>.
If you&amp;rsquo;re a Python developer you need &lt;code>virtualenv&lt;/code> in your life. You also need
&lt;code>virtualenvwrapper&lt;/code> too.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>virtualenvwrapper is a set of extensions to Ian Bicking’s virtualenv tool
for creating isolated Python development environments.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="installing-python-and-virtualenvwrapper">Installing Python and virtualenvwrapper&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Outlined below is how I install Python and &lt;code>virtualenvwrapper&lt;/code>. We have not
yet made the jump to Python 3 at work, hence the references to Python 2.6 and
2.7. Some of us develop on Arch Linux, but all deployments are on Ubuntu.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="arch-linux">Arch Linux&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>As Arch Linux is a rolling release we can simply install everything via
&lt;code>pacman&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo pacman -Syy
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo pacman -S --needed --noconfirm python-pip python-setuptools python-virtualenv
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo pacman -S --needed --noconfirm python2-pip python2-setuptools python2-virtualenv python-virtualenvwrapper&lt;span style="color:#87ceeb">&amp;#34;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Simple.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="ubuntu">Ubuntu&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The following was done on Ubuntu Lucid 10.04 LTS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Add some essential PPAs.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo apt-add-repository ppa:bzr/ppa

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo apt-add-repository ppa:fkrull/deadsnakes
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Update the system and install Python 2.6 and 2.7.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo apt-get update

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo apt-get install libpython2.7 python2.7 python2.7-dev python2.7-minimal
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Remove any &lt;code>apt&lt;/code> installed Python packages that we are about to repalce. The
versions of these packages in the Ubuntu repos and PPAs are too old.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo apt-get purge python-setuptools python-virtualenv python-pip python-profiler
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Install &lt;code>distribute&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Install &lt;code>pip&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>curl -O https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo python2.7 get-pip.py
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Use &lt;code>pip&lt;/code> to install &lt;code>virtualenv&lt;/code> and &lt;code>virtualenv&lt;/code> wrapper.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo pip-2.6 install virtualenv --upgrade

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Fairly simple.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-snakepit">The Snakepit&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This step is common to Arch Linux and Ubuntu. Create a &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Snakepit&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em> directory for
storing all the virtualenvs.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>mkdir ~/Snakepit
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Add the following your &lt;code>~/.bashrc&lt;/code> to enable &lt;code>virtualenvwrapper&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>export &lt;span style="color:#eedd82">WORKON_HOME&lt;/span>=&lt;span style="color:#87ceeb">${&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#eedd82">HOME&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#87ceeb">}&lt;/span>/Snakepit
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#f00">if&lt;/span> [ -f /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh ]; &lt;span style="color:#f00">then&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#f00">elif&lt;/span> [ -f /usr/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh ]; &lt;span style="color:#f00">then&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> source /usr/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#f00">fi&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="creating-a-virtualenv">Creating a virtualenv&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Open a new shell to ensure that the &lt;code>virtualenvwrapper&lt;/code> configuration is
active.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The following will create a new virtualenv called &lt;code>Nikola5&lt;/code> based on Python
2.7 and will not give access to the global &lt;code>site-packages&lt;/code> directory.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>mkvirtualenv -p python2.7 --no-site-packages ~/Snakepit/Nikola5
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>&lt;code>mkvirtualenv_help&lt;/code> shows a full list of arguments, the &lt;code>-r&lt;/code> switch can install
all the packages listed in a &lt;code>pip&lt;/code> requirements file into the newly created
virtualenv. Very useful.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="working-on-a-virtualenv">Working on a virtualenv&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To workon, or activate, an existing virtualenv do the following.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>workon Nikola5
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>You can switch to another virtualenv at any time, just use &lt;code>workon envname&lt;/code>.
Your shell prompt will change while a virtualenv is being worked on to indicate
which virtualenv is currently active.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While working on a virtualenv you can &lt;code>pip&lt;/code> install what you need or manually
install any Python libraries safe in the knowledge you will not adversely
damage any other virtualenvs or the global packages in the process. Very useful
for developing a new branch which may have different library requirements than
the master/head.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you are finished working in a virtualenv you can deactivate it by simply
executing:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>deactivate
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>That just about sums up my notes.&lt;/p></description><summary>Installing Python and virtualenv on Arch Linux and Ubuntu</summary></item><item><title>SSH brute force defense</title><link>https://wimpysworld.com/posts/ssh-brute-force-defense/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Nov 2012 13:14:09 +0000</pubDate><author>martin@wimpress.com (Martin Wimpress)</author><guid>https://wimpysworld.com/posts/ssh-brute-force-defense/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have several VPS hosts with different providers using different
virtualisation platforms. Naturally I have &lt;a href="http://www.openssh.org/">OpenSSH&lt;/a>
running on these VPS hosts and deploy either &lt;a href="http://denyhosts.sourceforge.net/">DenyHosts&lt;/a>
or &lt;a href="http://www.fail2ban.org/">Fail2Ban&lt;/a> to add an extra security layer to
thwart SSH brute force attacks and other abuse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>DenyHosts blocks brute force attacks by adding offending IP addresses to
&lt;code>/etc/hosts.deny&lt;/code>. It therefore requires the SSH server is configured with
&lt;code>tcp_wrappers&lt;/code>. Arch Linux &lt;a href="https://www.archlinux.org/news/dropping-tcp_wrappers-support/">dropped support for tcp_wrappers&lt;/a>
so DenyHosts is not suitable for Arch. Fail2Ban supports blocking via &lt;code>iptables&lt;/code> and/or
&lt;code>tcp_wrappers&lt;/code> and can also block offending hosts that are abusing services other than just &lt;code>sshd&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="denyhosts-on-ubuntu">DenyHosts on Ubuntu&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Here is a simple example for DenyHosts on Ubuntu Lucid 10.04 LTS Server.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo apt-get install denyhosts
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s it. The default configuration will provide suitable prevention, but do
take a look at &lt;code>/etc/denyhosts.conf&lt;/code> for a full run down of all available options.
I use the defaults with the following exceptions:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-ini" data-lang="ini">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>PURGE_DENY = &lt;span style="color:#87ceeb">5d&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>PURGE_THRESHOLD = &lt;span style="color:#87ceeb">2&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>ADMIN_EMAIL =
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>SYSLOG_REPORT=&lt;span style="color:#87ceeb">NO&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>You might want to consider whitelisting some of your own IP address. Create a
file called &lt;code>allowed-hosts&lt;/code> in &lt;code>/var/lib/denyhosts&lt;/code> and list each of your
&amp;ldquo;trusted&amp;rdquo; IP addresses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>DenyHosts can be restarted by executing:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo /etc/init.d/denyhosts restart
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="fail2ban-on-arch-linux">Fail2Ban on Arch Linux&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Fail2Ban now supports systemd.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Configuration files are stored in &lt;code>/etc/fail2ban&lt;/code>. General configuration is
&lt;code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf&lt;/code>, but this file might be overwritten in the future. To
preserve customisations, create &lt;code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.local&lt;/code> and add your local
configuration settings to it. In the example below some IP addresses are whitelisted
and the default backend is set to systemd:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-ini" data-lang="ini">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#f00">[DEFAULT]&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>ignoreip = &lt;span style="color:#87ceeb">172.16.0.2/32&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>backend = &lt;span style="color:#87ceeb">systemd&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Next create a custom sshd configuration in &lt;code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/sshd.conf&lt;/code>
which will temporarily ban offending IP addresses.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-ini" data-lang="ini">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#0f0"># fail2ban SSH&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#0f0"># block ssh after 3 unsuccessful login attempts for 10 minutes&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#f00">[sshd]&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>enabled = &lt;span style="color:#87ceeb">true&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>action = &lt;span style="color:#87ceeb">iptables[chain=INPUT, protocol=tcp, port=22, name=sshd]&lt;/span>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>findtime = &lt;span style="color:#87ceeb">600&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>bantime = &lt;span style="color:#87ceeb">600&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>port = &lt;span style="color:#87ceeb">22&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The &amp;lsquo;action&amp;rsquo; creates DROP rule in iptables after 3 unsuccessful login
attempts, valid for 10 minutes (bantime). Findtime defines time frame in which
fail2ban will count failed login attempts from logs, so if one IP has 3
incorrect login attempts in last 10 minutes, it will be banned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enable and start the Fail2Ban daemon.&lt;/p>

Mark Shuttleworth said:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>if you are a super-technologist then there is value in learning all about
linux from every angle try arch. try gentoo. try fedora. try debian. try suse.
they are all good&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>So, I did. I tried &lt;a href="http://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux&lt;/a> and it is is not
just good, it&amp;rsquo;s truly brilliant! The truth is, I didn&amp;rsquo;t take Mark
Shuttleworth&amp;rsquo;s advice. I took the advice of a quietly spoken work colleague.
Whenever he saw me getting frustrated with Ubuntu he reminded me (quietly)
that he was running Arch Linux and that it was really rather good.
It turns out I should have listened to my colleague years ago, because he
was right all along. He often is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I started learning Arch Linux a few weeks ago and as of the time of writing
all our home computers are running Arch Linux and so is my office workstation.
I moved away from Ubuntu (which I&amp;rsquo;ve been using daily since 2004) because:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I often find myself needing/wanting updated packages on my workstations.
Ubuntu + PPAs just wasn&amp;rsquo;t doing it for me anymore. I concluded I needed a rolling
release distribution.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In my humble opinion, Unity is a software engineering solution developed
(by programmers) not designed using UI-patterns (by user interface designers)
consequently it sucks the big one.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It was less hassle for me to switch to Arch Linux than bend Ubuntu to my will.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>That said, I do wish Canonical every success with Unity, they&amp;rsquo;ll need it, as
it needs some polish and refinement as it stands today. For anyone interested
in giving Arch Linux a try here are some observations.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Arch Linux does not hold you hand, you should be competent with a Linux
based distribution. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Linux since 0.99patch2 so I think I qualify.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Read the &lt;a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Beginners'_Guide">Unofficial Beginners&amp;rsquo; Guide&lt;/a>
and &lt;a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Official_Arch_Linux_Install_Guide">Official Installation Guide&lt;/a>
before you install anything.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Install Arch Linux in a virtual machine to get acquainted.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be prepared to fix &lt;em>your&lt;/em> own problems. Fortunately the
&lt;a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux Wiki&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux Forums&lt;/a>
are a great source of good information.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Here is a list of what I most like about Arch Linux:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It&amp;rsquo;s a rolling release. I&amp;rsquo;ve already progressed through several kernels
and been upgraded from GNOME 3.2 to 3.4. No fuss, no mess.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It keeps out of my way, I get to build the OS they way I want it.
&lt;em>Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m looking at you Unity, Overlay Scrollbars, Unity App Indicators, Ubuntu One and upstart!&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &lt;a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/index.php">AUR&lt;/a>. It&amp;rsquo;s like a great big PPA.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Creating my own packages is super simple.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Adding my own packages to the AUR is super simple. I&amp;rsquo;ve already contributed 8 packages.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m learning more about Linux than I have done in years.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m not so keen about, but can live with.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Some of the comments in the Forums and AUR are from real arse hats with a
superiority complex. New comers may be put off by their tone and look elsewhere.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &lt;a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/index.php">AUR&lt;/a>. Package quality in the AUR
is variable, some are pretty poor. So long as the maintainer is not one of the
aforementioned arse hats then contributing fixes and improvements is easy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It&amp;rsquo;s a rolling release, so may not be suitable for serious server deployments.
That said, I will migrate my own servers to Arch Linux in due course and see if
I can prove myself wrong.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>So there you have it, I like Arch Linux very much and recommend it to other
technically competent individuals looking to regain control of their computer(s).&lt;/p></description><summary>My experiences switching from Ubuntu to Arch Linux</summary></item><item><title>Install Sun Java 6 JRE and JDK from .deb packages</title><link>https://wimpysworld.com/posts/install-sun-java-6-jre-and-jdk-from-deb-packages/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jan 2012 13:20:05 +0000</pubDate><author>martin@wimpress.com (Martin Wimpress)</author><guid>https://wimpysworld.com/posts/install-sun-java-6-jre-and-jdk-from-deb-packages/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://canonical.com">Canonical&lt;/a> disabled my Java PPA at the end of last week.
So I&amp;rsquo;ve developed another solution for installing Java on Ubuntu which doesn&amp;rsquo;t
infringe any copyrights, licenses, terms of use or CoC&amp;rsquo;s. However, by running
this script to download Java you acknowledge that you have read and accepted the
terms of the Oracle end user license agreement.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/terms/license/">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/terms/license/&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>My script is an automated wrapper for &lt;a href="https://github.com/rraptorr/sun-java6">Janusz Dziemidowicz Debian packaging
scripts for Java 6&lt;/a>. My new script
simply downloads the Java binary installers from Oracle, builds the .deb
packages locally on your computer and creates a local &amp;lsquo;apt&amp;rsquo; repository for
them. Once my script has been executed you can then &amp;lsquo;apt-get&amp;rsquo; install/upgrade
Java 6 from your local repository. Packages are compatible with &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo;
Ubuntu ones and pre-existing Java 6 packages will upgrade cleanly. You can
find the script and full usage instructions on github.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>My Java PPA has been disabled by Canonical, possibly because they violate the Ubuntu CoC and PPA terms of use, as Jef Spaleta noted in the comments below, although I&amp;rsquo;ve had no communication from Canonical at this time. I&amp;rsquo;m preparing an alternative solution, for those of you who need Sun Java 6, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t violate and copyrights, CoCs or terms of use. A new blog post will be made when that alternate solution is available.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="update-monday-16th-january-2012">Update Monday 16th January 2012&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>I&amp;rsquo;ve developed another solution for installing Java 6u30 on Ubuntu which
doesn&amp;rsquo;t infringe any copyrights, licenses, terms of use or CoC&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="2012-01-install-sun-java-6-jre-jdk-from-deb-packages.html">Install Sun Java 6 JRE and JDK from .deb packages&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;del>Sun Java 6 packages are being removed from Ubuntu in the near future for the
following reasons:&lt;/del>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;del>As of August 24th 2011, Canonical no longer have permission to redistribute
new Java packages as Oracle has retired the &amp;ldquo;Operating System Distributor
License for Java&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/del>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;del>Oracle has published an advisory about security issues in the version of
Java currently in the partner archive. Some of these issues are currently
being exploited in the wild.&lt;/del>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;del>Due to the severity of the security risk, &lt;strong>Canonical released a security
update for the Sun JDK browser plugin which disables the plugin on all machines&lt;/strong>.&lt;/del>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;del>In the near future, &lt;strong>Canonical will remove all Sun JDK packages from the
Partner archive&lt;/strong>. This will be accomplished by pushing empty packages to
the archive, so that the Sun JDK will be removed from all users machines
when they do a software update. &lt;strong>Users of these packages who have not
migrated to an alternative solution will experience failures after the
package updates have removed Oracle Java from the system&lt;/strong>.&lt;/del>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;del>See the full Canonical notice below.&lt;/del>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;del>My personal motivations for creating this PPA are as follows:&lt;/del>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;del>I require Sun Java 6 for two enterprise applications we use at work. OpenJDK is not fully compatible.&lt;/del>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;del>I require Sun Java 6 for two desktop applications at home (so does my father-in-law). OpenJDK not compatible in one instance and not fully compatible in the other.&lt;/del>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;del>I require Sun Java 6 browser plugin for a web applications I use at home. OpenJDK is not compatible.&lt;/del>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;del>A friend of mine requires Sun Java 6 for building AOSP from source. OpenJDK is not compatible.&lt;/del>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;del>Some friends of mine play Minecraft, apparently this will help ;-)&lt;/del>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;del>Janusz Dziemidowicz made it easy for me - &lt;a href="https://github.com/rraptorr/sun-java6">https://github.com/rraptorr/sun-java6&lt;/a>&lt;/del>
&lt;del>The PPA currently publishes Sun Java 6 1.6.0.30 for:&lt;/del>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;del>Lucid i386/amd64&lt;/del>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;del>Maverick i386/amd64&lt;/del>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;del>Natty i386/amd64&lt;/del>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;del>Oneiric i386/amd64&lt;/del>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;del>Precise i386. However, amd64 is failing to build on Precise. I will try and fix this in due course.&lt;/del>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;del>To Sun Java 6 , previously installed via packages, do the following.&lt;/del>&lt;/p>

Oneiric 11.10. We&amp;rsquo;ve agreed to hate each other. A few weeks ago I started using
&lt;a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME 3&lt;/a> and it only took me a couple of hours to
adapt to it&amp;rsquo;s workflow. GNOME 3 is now my desktop environment at home and and
work. I love it! If you&amp;rsquo;d like to give GNOME 3 a whirl then you could try
installing Jan Hoffman&amp;rsquo;s Ubuntu GNOME Shell Remix from either the 32-bit or
64-bit ISOs he has prepared. This will give a &amp;ldquo;pure&amp;rdquo; GNOME 3 experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://ubuntu-gs-remix.sourceforge.net/p/home/">http://ubuntu-gs-remix.sourceforge.net/p/home/&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If you already have Ubuntu 11.10 installed then you can install GNOME 3 alongside
Unity. Here are the incantations you&amp;rsquo;ll need to utter in a shell.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo apt-add-repository ppa:jan-hoffmann/gnome-shell

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo apt-add-repository ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo apt-add-repository ppa:webupd8team/gnome3
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo apt-get update

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The repositories added above will give you access to Jan&amp;rsquo;s GNOME 3 meta
packages, updated GNOME 3 packages and some extra GNOME 3 extensions. GNOME 3
extensions add all manner of additional tweaks and functionality. Some
extensions can even provide a user experience more akin to that of GNOME 2.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://intgat.tigress.co.uk/rmy/extensions/index.html">http://intgat.tigress.co.uk/rmy/extensions/index.html&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In order to get acquainted with GNOME 3 I suggest you read the
&lt;a href="http://www.gnome.org/gnome-3/">Discover GNOME 3&lt;/a> (watch the videos too) and
&lt;a href="http://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell/CheatSheet">GNOME 3 Cheat Sheet&lt;/a> pages. Having
read those you&amp;rsquo;ll soon master GNOME 3. After you&amp;rsquo;ve used GNOME 3 for a while you
may conclude it is a more usable desktop environment than Unity, which isn&amp;rsquo;t a
surprising conclusion to arrive at given Unity sucks the big one right now. If
you want a &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;pure&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em> GNOME 3 experience then the following commands will purge
Unity and other bits and bobs that GNOME 3 simply doesn&amp;rsquo;t require.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="remove-unity">Remove Unity&lt;/h2>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo apt-purge unity unity-2d unity-2d-launcher unity-asset-pool unity-common &lt;span style="color:#87ceeb">\

&lt;p>These just don&amp;rsquo;t work on my netbook since they regularly obscure portions of
the window I actually want to click on. The can safely be removed even if you
intend to continue using Unity.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo apt-get purge overlay-scrollbar liboverlay-scrollbar-0.2-0 liboverlay-scrollbar3-0.2-0
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="remove-indicators">Remove Indicators&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you never going back to Unity, Indicators can be safely removed.&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="remove-global-menu">Remove Global Menu&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Again, Global Menu is not used by GNOME 3. So if you not going back to Unity
these can be safely removed.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo apt-get purge appmenu-gtk3 appmenu-gtk appmenu-qt firefox-globalmenu &lt;span style="color:#87ceeb">\

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Finally, a word or warning: &lt;strong>Distribution upgrades are not possible!&lt;/strong> You
can&amp;rsquo;t upgrade to a newer version of Ubuntu when using Jan Hoffman&amp;rsquo;s Ubuntu
GNOME Shell Remix or if you modify an existing Ubuntu 11.10 using my method
above. You will have to do a full install once the next Ubuntu release is
available. This can&amp;rsquo;t be fixed as long as Jan&amp;rsquo;s meta packages are unofficial,
because the distribution upgrade process requires having installed one of the
desktop meta packages from the official Ubuntu repositories.&lt;/p></description><summary>Creating a pure GNOME 3 experience on Ubuntu 11.10</summary></item><item><title>Shotwell 0.11 PPA available for Ubuntu Lucid and Maverick</title><link>https://wimpysworld.com/posts/shotwell-0.11-ppa-available-for-ubuntu-lucid-and-maverick/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Aug 2011 11:05:50 +0000</pubDate><author>martin@wimpress.com (Martin Wimpress)</author><guid>https://wimpysworld.com/posts/shotwell-0.11-ppa-available-for-ubuntu-lucid-and-maverick/</guid><description>&lt;p>Like many others I wanted &lt;a href="http://yorba.org/shotwell/">Shotwell&lt;/a> 0.11

&lt;a href="http://yorba.org/shotwell/">Shotwell&lt;/a>. Shotwell is a photo organiser
for &lt;a href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME&lt;/a> that I&amp;rsquo;ve been testing for a few
months now but the recent 0.5 release which added tagging and printing,
it means Shotwell is finally ready replace &lt;a href="http://f-spot.org">F-Spot&lt;/a> on
my workstation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Shotwell is intuitive, well documented, extremely easy to use and reliable.
It&amp;rsquo;s easy to dismiss Shotwell as an over simplified photo manager. But once
you start using it, you&amp;rsquo;ll quickly appreciate its clean interface and
easy-to-use tools. Don&amp;rsquo;t just take my word for it either, Shotwell is now the
default photo manager in &lt;a href="http://fedoraproject.org">Fedora&lt;/a> 13 alpha. Here is
a quick run down of the features.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Import photos from folders or from any digital camera supported by gPhoto.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shotwell automatically groups photos taken at the same time. You can also
use tags to organize your photo collection.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can rotate, crop, reduce red-eye, and adjust the exposure, saturation,
tint, and temperature of each photo.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Publish photos to Facebook, Flickr and Picasa Web Albums.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Shotwell provides a non-destructive way to tweak your photos. Instead of
modifying the original photos, Shotwell stores all edits in a database and
applies them on-the-fly as necessary. This means that you can easily undo all
edits. Shotwell comes equipped with all the usual photo enhancing tools and
slideshow. You can download a source tarball from the Shotwell home page at
&lt;a href="http://www.yorba.org/shotwell/">http://www.yorba.org/shotwell/&lt;/a> or grab a binary for Ubuntu Karmic or Lucid
via Yorba&amp;rsquo;s Launchpad PPA.&lt;/p>

they released their Linux client for downloading the MP3s you purchased. I
don&amp;rsquo;t care, I just want to say I&amp;rsquo;m really impressed Amazon have considered us
Linux users. Well done Amazon!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not only that but the MP3s are DRM free, encoded using variable bit rates aiming
at an average of 256 kilobits per second (kbps), album cover art is included with
each song and the tracks are typically cheaper than iTunes. Well done again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Doubtless some would want an Open Source client and unencumbered formats such as
Ogg and FLAC, but I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy with what Amazon have on offer so long as it
works. Which it does.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the Linux MP3 downloader client is 32-bit only. Not so good, but
it can be successfully installed in 64-bit Ubuntu. Here&amp;rsquo;s how I did in on

We&amp;rsquo;re moving house. Hence, not much time for geeky stuff
recently. I&amp;rsquo;ve been putting this off for ages, I need to &amp;ldquo;normalise&amp;rdquo; the
volume of my MP3 music music library. Not all CDs sound equally loud. Whilst
different musical moods require that some tracks should sound louder than
others, the loudness of a given CD has more to do with the year of issue or
the whim of the producer than the intended emotional effect. This difference
carries over when you rip the CD to MP3 and random play through my music
collection requires constant manual volume adjustment. This has been bugging
me for a while now, but when it started to bug my wife I knew it was time to
find a solution. My main concerns with applying some sort of audio
normalisation were&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>My MP3s should not be irretrievably changed into something I end up hating.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The method used should be free of the application used for music playback,
given that I play my music on iPod Nano, iPod Shuffle, PSP, PS3, Linux desktops,
TomTom 720T FM streaming and in car MP3 player.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>After some research &lt;a href="http://mp3gain.sourceforge.net">mp3gain&lt;/a> seems to be the
tool for the job which provides an implementation of
&lt;a href="http://www.replaygain.org/">ReplayGain&lt;/a>. However, as of today my entire CD
collection is ripped, which is very large, so I needed a way to process my
whole music collection in an automated fashion. I found some examples of how
to script this, but there are caveats with the solutions I found. Therefore I
have created my own script, MP3Gainer, to apply ReplayGain using &lt;code>mp3gain&lt;/code>
which overcomes these common limitations. MP3Gainer recursively applies
ReplayGain to a MP3 music collection of any size and directory depth.
ReplayGain can be applied in &amp;rsquo;track&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;album&amp;rsquo; mode and if ReplayGain has
previously been applied it can also be undone. It is important to understand
that MP3Gainer &amp;lsquo;album&amp;rsquo; mode really is per album, which is what you want. Trust
me! This script works on Ubuntu, should work on any other Linux/Unix
flavour and possibly Mac OS X providing you have the required tools installed.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/NetworkManager/">NetworkManager&lt;/a> package was
changed so that &lt;code>nm-applet&lt;/code> (the system tray application) was separated into
it&amp;rsquo;s own package. After I updated and installed &lt;code>nm-applet&lt;/code>, I noticed that it
didn&amp;rsquo;t startup anymore. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to investigate until this morning and
found the answer in the following forum posting&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=134251">NetworkManager broken after last update&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Here is the pearl of wisdom, from that forum discussion, that helped me make
my system to be NetworkManager compatible again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Network Manager has been installed on your system, however it will not
immediately be able to manage your network interfaces. To avoid problems with
important configuration being ignored, or strange behaviours, the Ubuntu version
will not manage any network interface configured in the /etc/network/interfaces file.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>To allow interfaces to be managed with Network Manager either edit the
/etc/network/interfaces file and remove (or comment out) the &amp;ldquo;auto&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;iface&amp;rdquo;
lines for those interfaces you wish it to manage, or use the &amp;ldquo;Networking&amp;rdquo;
administration tool (found under the &amp;ldquo;System&amp;rdquo; menu) to disable the interfaces.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description><summary>Fixing NetworkManager applet on Ubuntu 6.04</summary></item><item><title>The honeymoon is over</title><link>https://wimpysworld.com/posts/the-honeymoon-is-over/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Feb 2006 11:43:06 +0000</pubDate><author>martin@wimpress.com (Martin Wimpress)</author><guid>https://wimpysworld.com/posts/the-honeymoon-is-over/</guid><description>&lt;p>Despite my glowing comments about &lt;a href="http://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora&lt;/a> a couple
of weeks back, the honeymoon period is well and truly over. My biggest gripe
with Fedora is even with numerous compatible repositories enabled there isn&amp;rsquo;t a
suitable selection of packages available and dependency breakage is all too
frequent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although I can build my own packages from source I just don&amp;rsquo;t have the time
(or inclination) for that anymore. I do really like the Early Logon feature and
the working NetworkManager in Fedora, but sadly these features are not enough to
keep me away from Ubuntu. As a result I have just finished migrating all my
computers to Ubuntu Dapper Drake 6.04 - Flight 3, which is shaping up to be
another excellent release. Matt Galvin has been doing a great job of tracking
the new features in each of the Dapper Flight pre-releases, see the Wiki entries
below&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Having spent 6 weeks using Fedora I have decided that I have learnt enough
about it to conclude it just isn&amp;rsquo;t for me and I will be seeing out the rest of
2006 using Ubuntu as my desktop OS. However, I will dabble with other distros
periodically.&lt;/p></description><summary>Ditching Fedora and sticking with Ubuntu</summary></item><item><title>Leading edge Fedora Core 4</title><link>https://wimpysworld.com/posts/leading-edge-fedora-core-4/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jan 2006 11:32:31 +0000</pubDate><author>martin@wimpress.com (Martin Wimpress)</author><guid>https://wimpysworld.com/posts/leading-edge-fedora-core-4/</guid><description>&lt;p>Having spent all of 2005 using &lt;a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu&lt;/a> I have learnt a
lot about &lt;a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian&lt;/a> and even started using Debian for my
servers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite using Linux for over 10 years I had never previously used Debian and had
even avoided using it. I was surprised by how much I liked using Ubuntu and
Debian and decided that I give &lt;a href="http://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora&lt;/a> another try
as I have never warmed to &lt;a href="http://www.redhat.com/">redhat&lt;/a> in the same way I had
never previously warmed to Debian. For the longest time I used &lt;a href="http://www.slackware.com/">Slackware&lt;/a>
and then switched to &lt;a href="http://crux.nu/">Crux&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This week I have installed Fedora Core 4 on my home computer and been hugely
impressed, but this is mostly down to finding the nrpms.net repository. I was
already using the RPMforge.net group of repositories and nrpms.net is striving
for RPMforge compatibility, so far I haven&amp;rsquo;t experienced any package or
dependency breakage so they must be doing something right. Thanks to nrpms.net
I have effortlessly upgraded FC4 to GNOME 2.12.1, Firefox 1.5, mono 1.1.12 plus
numerous other GNOME applications I regularly use which aren&amp;rsquo;t available
elsewhere. The real bonus was to get NetworkManager 0.5.1 from nrpms.net which
actually works, and works reliably!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a result, this is a Linux distribution I can install on my wifes laptop
without fear of reprisals. I have found that installing proprietary
hardware drivers and software has been much simpler for Fedora than Ubuntu,
most notable are VMWare Player, Linuxant HSF modem drivers, ATI drivers, Opera
and Skype.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have been able to get my Smartphone and PocketPC working under Ubuntu
the amount of tweaking and constant manual intervention is cumbersome. So I
was staggered when after installing the SynCE packages on Fedora both devices
just worked when connected via USB, the whole process was completely seamless.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, after a few days tinkering I have everything I need installed, configured
and working reliably. Fedora is not perfect thought, &lt;code>yum&lt;/code> is still lagging
behind &lt;code>apt&lt;/code> and even that even after enabling a number of the excellent 3rd
party repositories the number and variety of packages available
to FC4 isn&amp;rsquo;t that great. Installing software is just so slow, what the bloody
hell is &lt;code>yum&lt;/code> doing? Using &lt;code>yumex&lt;/code> is coma inducing and &lt;code>up2date&lt;/code> just doesn&amp;rsquo;t
work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That said, there is some work being done in these areas for FC5 so maybe
the gap will be closed on &lt;code>apt&lt;/code> a little in the coming months. I do like the
fact that the official Fedora repositories update packages past the
final release date, something which Ubuntu doesn&amp;rsquo;t do. This means that on my
first &lt;code>yum update&lt;/code> OpenOffice was upgrade from 1.9.140 Beta to 2.0.1 final and
many other essential applications were also upgraded. Just when I thought it
couldn&amp;rsquo;t get any better I discovered the &amp;ldquo;Early Login&amp;rdquo; feature which is new to
Fedora Core 4. It is simply brilliant and I can not get from power button to
GNOME desktop in 20 seconds. I so wanted to not like Fedora but I have to say
I think I might be converted. I will have to see how long this enthusiasm for
Fedora will last, but I am already looking forward to FC5.&lt;/p></description><summary>Taking a look at Fedora Core 4</summary></item><item><title>Powerbook G3 (Old World) Ubuntu Install</title><link>https://wimpysworld.com/posts/powerbook-g3-old-world-ubuntu-install/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2006 11:28:54 +0000</pubDate><author>martin@wimpress.com (Martin Wimpress)</author><guid>https://wimpysworld.com/posts/powerbook-g3-old-world-ubuntu-install/</guid><description>&lt;p>James bought a PowerBook G3 to the January 2006 &lt;a href="http://www.hants.lug.org.uk/">HantsLUG&lt;/a>
meeting and wanted to have Ubuntu installed on it. I used to be familiar with
Apple Mac computers in the mid to late 90&amp;rsquo;s because the company I worked for used
Macs exclusively on the desktop, so I decided to give it a whirl.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bottom line is that this old PowerBook G3 is now running Ubuntu Hoary 5.04
quite happily and I will soon be phone James to arrange for him to pick up his
computer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The article is largely based on the &lt;a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Installation/OldWorldMacs">OldWorldsMac Ubuntu Wiki&lt;/a>,
I have included the specifics of James setup here so he has a record of how his
computer was configured.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I quickly realised that simply inserting the Ubuntu Hoary 5.04 PowerPC install
CD and rebooting while holding down the &amp;lsquo;C&amp;rsquo; key wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to work. It seems
that James computer is old enough to be a right pain in the arse to get working
with Linux, but that just makes me want to get it working all the more &lt;code>:-)&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By the end of the HantsLUG meeting Ubuntu Hoary 5.04 was just completing the
final setup steps and would have been ready to use, but someone pulled the power
block out of the mains and James battery is dead, so the computer shutdown &lt;code>:-(&lt;/code>
I took the PowerBook G3 home with me to fix/complete the installation but when
I got home I decided to download Ubuntu Breezy and install that instead. Sadly,
James PowerBook only has a 2GB hard disk (1.9GB available for Linux) and this
wasn&amp;rsquo;t sufficient for the Breezy installation to complete so I reverted to Hoary.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="identifying-the-powerbook-g3">Identifying the PowerBook G3&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>After some Googling I soon discovered that there are two classes of PowerBook G3,
OldWorld and NewWorld, and that each of the classes have a number of slightly
different models in the range. I took a guess that James was an OldWorld
PowerBook based on the fact it had no USB ports. It turns out this was a good
guess.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Making the assumption that James PowerBook was OldWorld meant that I should use
&lt;a href="http://penguinppc.org/bootloaders/bootx/">BootX&lt;/a> to boot into Linux from MacOS
as opposed to using yaboot which is for NewWorld PowerPCs.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="doing-the-macos-installation">Doing the MacOS Installation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The first job was to erase the hard disk and install MacOS in a small parition
and leave the rest of the drive unallocated for installing Ubuntu later on.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Insert MacOS 8.1 CD&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reboot&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hold down &amp;lsquo;C&amp;rsquo; as the computer boots to get it to boot from CD&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Erase the Hard Disk&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use Drive Setup to make a 150MB HFS partition.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Install MacOS, leaving off all the optional components. The only thing you need is Stuffit and a browser which are both part of the minimal MacOS8.1 install.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>After the install I delete some odds and ends I didn&amp;rsquo;t need and also used
Extensions Manager to deselect a lot of components that were not required.
Finally, I configured TCP/IP to use DHCP.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="tools-update">Tools Update&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>James wanted to be able to use MacOS for basic web surfing, so that meant
finding an more modern alternative to Netscape 3.0.3 which was installed be
default. Sadly The only (relatively) upto date browser I could find which would
install on MacOS 8.1 was Internet Explorer 5.1.7. I also needed an updated
version of Stuffit Expander to extract BootX 1.2.2. I used Netscape 3.0.3 to
download IE and Stuffit from the URL&amp;rsquo;s below&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mac/downloads.aspx?pid=download&amp;amp;location=/mac/DOWNLOAD/IE/ie5_classic.xml&amp;amp;secid=30&amp;amp;ssid=11&amp;amp;flgnosysreq=True">Internet Explorer 5.1.7 for Mac OS 8.1 to 9.x&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://www.sfsu.edu/ftp/mac/utils/aladdin_exp55.hqx">Stuffit Expander 5.5 for MacOS Classic&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;and installed them. Once they were working a deleted Netscpae 3.0.3 and the
old version of Stuffit.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="bootx">BootX&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Older versions of Stuffit will only extract BootX 1.1.3 which I why I updated
Stuffit Expander as explained earlier. Download BootX 1.2.2.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://penguinppc.org/bootloaders/bootx/">BootX&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Open it with Stuffit and extract it the the Desktop then open the resulting
BootX 1.2.2 folder on the desktop. Drag each of the following&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>BootX&lt;/li>
&lt;li>BootX Extension&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Linux Kernels&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;onto the &amp;ldquo;System Folder&amp;rdquo; one at a time to install BootX correctly. Insert the
Ubuntu PPC install CD and navigate to the &lt;code>/install/powerpc&lt;/code> folder.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Copy &lt;code>vmlinux&lt;/code> to (the Linux kernel) &lt;code>System Folder/Linux Kernels&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Copy &lt;code>initrd.gz&lt;/code> (the init ramdisk image) to &lt;code>System Folder/&lt;/code> and rename it to &lt;code>ramdisk.image.gz&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>BootX should appear on the apple menu and also run on every reboot during the
boot process, meaning that you can choose to boot Linux without having to wait
for the entire MacOS to load &lt;code>:-)&lt;/code> When you run BootX it should show &amp;lsquo;vmlinux&amp;rsquo;
as an available kernel, now add the following to &amp;ldquo;More kernel arguments&amp;rdquo; to make
sure the correct video mode is used for Linux.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>video=atyfb:vmode:14,cmode:32,mclk:71
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Now click the &amp;ldquo;Options&amp;rdquo; button, check &amp;ldquo;Use Specified RAM disk&amp;rdquo; and select
&lt;code>System Folder/ramdisk.image.gz&lt;/code>. Click on the &amp;ldquo;Save to prefs&amp;rdquo; button and then
click on the &amp;ldquo;Linux&amp;rdquo; button and in a short while you should be looking at the
regular Ubuntu install dialogs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="other-video-mode-suggestions">Other Video Mode Suggestions&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I didn&amp;rsquo;t test these, but my understanding is the &amp;lsquo;cmode&amp;rsquo; choose the bit depth 8
for 8bit, 16, for 16bit and so one. &amp;lsquo;mclk&amp;rsquo; controls the graphics/monitor refresh
rate I think, I was lucky that I the video mode suggested in the BootX README
worked first go.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>video=atyfb:vmode:14,cmode:32,mclk:65
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>video=atyfb:vmode:14,cmode:8,mclk:63
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="doing-the-ubuntu-installation">Doing the Ubuntu Installation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The installer will display an error message that &amp;ldquo;Configure a multiseat system&amp;rdquo;
failed. You can ignore this&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Select &amp;lsquo;Continue&amp;rsquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Select &amp;lsquo;Detect Hardware&amp;rsquo; and press Enter&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;and the install will continue normally.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="partitioning">Partitioning&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When it gets to partitioning the drive Ubuntu will suggest using the entire disk
for Linux. Don&amp;rsquo;t do that because you still need MacOS to run BootX to bootstrap
Linux. Select the &amp;ldquo;Use Free Space&amp;rdquo; option or partition manually.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="copying-boot-to-the-hfs-system-folder">Copying /boot to the HFS System Folder&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The rest of the install is fairly straight forward until you get to the part
where Ubuntu tries to install a bootloader. GRUB and Lilo don&amp;rsquo;t work on OldWorld
Macs, so Ubuntu will warn you that no bootloader can be installed. Switch to a
second console at this point (Option-F2) and use &lt;code>df&lt;/code> to see where things are
currently mounted. In my case the newly installed ubuntu was on &lt;code>/dev/hda8&lt;/code>
mounted as &lt;code>/target&lt;/code> and the HFS filesystem was &lt;code>/dev/hda7&lt;/code>. Make a mountpoint
and mount the HFS filesystem.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>cd /target
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>mkdir hfs
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>mount /dev/hda7 hfs -t hfs
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>You might also want to add an entry to &lt;code>/etc/fstab&lt;/code> so it will be mounted when
you reboot. This makes updating kernels easier in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>echo &lt;span style="color:#87ceeb">&amp;#39;/dev/hda7 /hfs hfs defaults&amp;#39;&lt;/span> &amp;gt;&amp;gt; etc/fstab
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Now copy the kernel and boot image over;&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>cp boot/vmlinux hfs/System&lt;span style="color:#87ceeb">\ &lt;/span>Folder/Linux&lt;span style="color:#87ceeb">\ &lt;/span>Kernels/vmlinux
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>cp boot/initrd.img hfs/System&lt;span style="color:#87ceeb">\ &lt;/span>Folder/ramdisk.image.gz
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Option-F1 to get back to the installer, and tell it to go ahead and reboot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When the machine reboots the BootX dialog should come up straight away, just
click &amp;ldquo;Linux&amp;rdquo; and Ubuntu should proceed through the rest of the install as usual.&lt;/p>

There are not any obvious differences between Dapper and Breezy at this early
stage but one thing which does stand out is the performance improvements. My
test Dapper and stable Breezy computers are exactly the same specification and
the boot times for Dapper are vastly improved, currently 37 seconds (average)
faster from power on to GNOME desktop than with Breezy. The graphical boot menu
when booting from the install CD in a nice touch, I look forward to seeing how
Dapper improves over the coming months. But right now there isn&amp;rsquo;t anything
especially new, different or unusual to test.&lt;/p></description><summary>Ubuntu Dapper Drake is showing some performance improvements</summary></item><item><title>Ubuntu Backports and PLF Repositories</title><link>https://wimpysworld.com/posts/ubuntu-backports-and-plf-repositories/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Dec 2005 11:19:04 +0000</pubDate><author>martin@wimpress.com (Martin Wimpress)</author><guid>https://wimpysworld.com/posts/ubuntu-backports-and-plf-repositories/</guid><description>&lt;p>I haven&amp;rsquo;t been focusing on Linux during that last couple of months, I was a
