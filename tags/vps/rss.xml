I&amp;rsquo;ve been using
the same shared host for over 7 years but these days I really need much better
control over my server, mostly for spam/virus protection of e-mail but also to
ensure that periodic upgrades don&amp;rsquo;t screw up my website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So this time I opted for a virtual dedicated server and I had a choice of all
the popular Linux distros, which I can re-install via a web interface at will
in a few seconds. I choose. If you are looking for a low cost virtual dedicated
server then take a look at &lt;a href="http://www.quantact.com">Quantact&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description><summary>After 7 shared on a shared host it&amp;rsquo;s time for a VPS</summary></item></channel></rss>
