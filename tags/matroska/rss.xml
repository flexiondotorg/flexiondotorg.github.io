Therefore I&amp;rsquo;ve written a script that
creates a PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 compatible MPEG-4 from Matroska providing
the video is H.264 and audio is AC3 or DTS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Xbox 360 compatibility requires that audio is forcibly downmixed to stereo
with &lt;code>--stereo&lt;/code>. AAC 5.1 audio will have the correct channel assignments when
transcoding from AC3 5.1 and DTS 5.1. If &lt;code>neroAacEnc&lt;/code> is installed then it is
used in preference to &lt;code>faac&lt;/code> for encoding the AAC audio, as it produces better
quality output. &lt;code>neroAacEnc&lt;/code> is optional.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The script does as little re-encoding as possible, only the audio and
subtitles are re-encoded or converted. The script can detect profile 5.1 H.264
and patch it to 4.1 in under a second. Any subtitles in the Matroska are
preserved. If &lt;code>mp4creator&lt;/code> is used the subtitles are extracted stored in a
seperate file. If &lt;code>MP4Box&lt;/code> is used (default) the subtitles are converted to
GPAC Timed Text and muxed into the resulting MPEG-4. The PlayStation 3 can&amp;rsquo;t
display these subtitles but some software players can.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The script can optionally split the Matroska if it is greater than 4GB to ensure
PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and FAT32 compatibility. This script works on Ubuntu and
should work on any other Linux/Unix flavour and possibly Mac OS X providing you
have the required tools installed.&lt;/p>

Therefore I&amp;rsquo;ve written a
script that creates a PlayStation 3 compatible M2TS from a MKV,
assuming video is H.264 and audio is AC3 or DTS with as little
re-encoding as possible. Any subtitles in the MKV are preserved
in the M2TS although the PlayStation 3 can&amp;rsquo;t display subtitles in M2TS
containers. Optionally splits the M2TS, if it is greater than 4GB,
to maintain FAT32 compatibility. Unlike other MKV to M2TS solutions,
this script doesn&amp;rsquo;t create any intermediate files during the conversion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The PlayStation 3 can&amp;rsquo;t play DTS audio streams in M2TS containers, therefore
DTS audio is transcoded to AC3.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This script works on Ubuntu, should work on any other Linux/Unix flavour and
possibly Mac OS X providing you have the required tools installed.&lt;/p>

access at home for a month. Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m online again and I have been tinkering
with various projects the most recent of which is Matroska conversion (again).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="matroska-to-mp4">Matroska to MP4&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For sometime I have been converting Martoska files to MPEG-4 with AAC 5.1 audio
so I can stream them via Mediatomb to my PlayStation 3. The conversion process
works well although there is some overhead in transcoding the audio and the
AAC 5.1 audio is not as good quality as the original AC3 or DTS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are interested I&amp;rsquo;ve put my code in GitHub, the script automates the
whole process.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/flexiondotorg/MKV-to-MP4">MPV-to-MP4&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="matroska-to-m2ts">Matroska to M2TS&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A little while back I read it was possible to convert those same Matroska file
to M2TS files which, so long as the audio is AC3, so takes much less time to
convert. As the PlayStation 3 can&amp;rsquo;t play DTS audio streams inside a M2TS container
there is still a requirement to transcode DTS to AC3. That said the conversion to
M2TS requires less file I/O than converting to MPEG-4 and is therefore it is
generally a quicker conversion method, typically just 2 or 3 minutes on my
workstation at home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plus the audio quality of the AC3 or transcoded DTS is better than that of
transcoded AAC 5.1. I&amp;rsquo;ve created my own script to fully automate the conversion
process. The script has been tested on Ubuntu 8.10 64-bit but there is an
outside chance it will work on Mac OS X if you can get the required tools
installed. Again, you can find my script on GitHub.&lt;/p>
