decided to give &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/minidlna/">MiniDLNA&lt;/a> a whirl
since it is a fully fledged DLNA server whereas Mediatomb is UPnP only. I&amp;rsquo;m
currently running both Mediatomb SVN and MiniDLNA CVS. So, how does MiniDLNA
compare to Mediatomb?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>MiniDLNA is easier to compile, configure, uses less RAM and has less software
dependencies than Mediatomb.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>MiniDLNA doesn&amp;rsquo;t currently support music play lists or Last.fm scrobbling.
Mediatomb supports &lt;code>.m3u&lt;/code> and &lt;code>.pls&lt;/code> playlists but requires a 3rd party patch
to add Last.fm scrobbling.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>MiniDLNA doesn&amp;rsquo;t support dynamic video thumbnail creation, which would be
nice to have but is not essential, cover images are supported. Mediatomb
supports video thumbnails via &lt;code>ffmpegthumbnailer&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>MiniDLNA doesn&amp;rsquo;t currently have any transcoding support. This is of little
consequence for me since I import video content into my library in a format
natively supported by the PS3, either MP3, MPEG-2 TS or MPEG-4. Mediatomb
does support transcoding but it is somewhat fiddly to setup and you can&amp;rsquo;t
pause transcoded content.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>MiniDLNA works &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;out of the box&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em> with the PS3 (and other DLNA clients)
while Mediatomb requires some tweaking.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mediatomb&amp;rsquo;s default video import script doesn&amp;rsquo;t suit how I organise my
video library, but MiniDLNA suits my video library perfectly.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>So, as of today I am running both Mediatomb and MiniDLNA. Mediatomb is
exclusively handling audio since playlist and Last.fm support are essential
for me. MiniDLNA is now handling video exclusively. I&amp;rsquo;m very happy with the
results but should MiniDLNA add .m3u/.pls play lists and Last.fm support I
will switch everything to MiniDLNA.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="2-years-later">2 years later&amp;hellip;&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Since writing this post MiniDLNA added support for playlists. It still doesn&amp;rsquo;t
support Last.fm scrobbling though. Despite that I switched to MiniDLNA and it
has been streaming audio and video around the house for that last couple of
years.&lt;/p></description><summary>Comparing Mediatomb and MiniDLNA streaming servers</summary></item><item><title>PS3, Mediatomb, Multi Zone Music streaming</title><link>https://wimpysworld.com/posts/ps3-mediatomb-multi-zone-music-streaming/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Sep 2009 11:02:52 +0000</pubDate><author>martin@wimpress.com (Martin Wimpress)</author><guid>https://wimpysworld.com/posts/ps3-mediatomb-multi-zone-music-streaming/</guid><description>&lt;p>PlayStation 3 firmware 3.00 added a new feature I was very excited about,
multi-av output. Today I finally got round to re-wiring the home cinema system
to make use of this new feature. I now have the PS3 streaming music from
&lt;a href="http://mediatomb.cc/">MediaTomb&lt;/a> with my A/V receiver sending audio to Zone
1 via digital inter connects and also sending audio to Zone 2 via analog stereo
interconnects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Zone 1 is a 5.1 speaker setup and Zone 2 is a 2.0 all weather wireless speaker
system which are often in the kitchen but also moved outside for parties. If
Sony could just add Skype to the PS3 and allow the PSP Remote Play to output
audio to both the PS3 and PSP (rather than just one of them) I would be very
happy indeed.&lt;/p></description><summary>Multi Zone music streaming with the PlayStation 3</summary></item><item><title>Mediatomb 0.12 - Streaming audio and video around the house</title><link>https://wimpysworld.com/posts/mediatomb-0.12-streaming-audio-and-video-around-the-house/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2009 16:23:39 +0000</pubDate><author>martin@wimpress.com (Martin Wimpress)</author><guid>https://wimpysworld.com/posts/mediatomb-0.12-streaming-audio-and-video-around-the-house/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://mediatomb.cc/">Mediatomb&lt;/a> is an open source (GPL) UPnP MediaServer
with a nice web user interface, it allows you to stream your digital media
through your home network and listen to/watch it on a variety of UPnP
compatible devices, such as the PlayStation in my case.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mediatomb 0.12 is not yet released as final yet but it is certainly stable
enough for general use, so I spent the last week migrating from Mediatomb 0.11
to Mediatomb 0.12.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently finished ripping my entire CD collection (344 CDs) to MP3 and I
am currently ripping my DVD collection (85 done so far) to MP4 with AAC 5.1
audio. The &amp;lsquo;Music&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Video&amp;rsquo; folders in our home directories are mounted via
NFS. The Mediatomb server uses the same data sources so any playlists or new
music/videos we might import are immediately reflected in Mediatomb.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our entire CD library is now available at the click of a button, automatically
organised by genre, artist and date. We have also created some playlists
in &lt;code>.m3u&lt;/code> or &lt;code>.pls&lt;/code> format.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>New to Mediatomb 0.12 is the ability to scrobble your music to
&lt;a href="http://www.last.fm">Last.fm&lt;/a>, this a killer feature for me and why I chose to
migrate to 0.12 before it goes final.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I ripped the CDs using &lt;a href="http://www.burtonini.com/blog/computers/sound-juicer">SoundJuicer&lt;/a>,
since I can configure it to use &lt;a href="http://lame.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/lame/lame/doc/html/presets.html">LAME presets&lt;/a>.
I then used the &lt;a href="http://musicbrainz.org/doc/PicardTagger">Music Brainz Picard Tagger&lt;/a> to
add additional tagging and embed cover art and then applied ReplayGain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally my wife and I use &lt;a href="http://banshee-project.org/">Banshee&lt;/a> to manage the
music library on our computers, including the creation of playlists and syncing
to our iPods.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am using &lt;a href="http://handbrake.fr/">Handbrake&lt;/a> to rip the DVDs to MP4. I&amp;rsquo;ve created a
new PS3 compatible profile which is focused on quality, I&amp;rsquo;ll post details
about that in the future. Mediatomb 0.12 has some experimental features to
stream video content from .ISO images of DVDs. I&amp;rsquo;ve yet to play with that but
it sounds very cool. I&amp;rsquo;ve also created a script which queries IMDB to
categorise our film library by genre and create summary information about
each film in the library. I&amp;rsquo;ll be posting more about that soon. I haven&amp;rsquo;t
finalised how we will integrate Photo management with Mediatomb yet, but that
is that final piece in the puzzle.&lt;/p></description><summary>In home streaming via UPnP with Mediatomb</summary></item></channel></rss>
