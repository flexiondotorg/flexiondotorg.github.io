operating system purpose built for retro gaming. Built with
&lt;a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu&lt;/a> and using the minimalist emulator frontend
&lt;a href="https://ludo.libretro.com/">Ludo&lt;/a> it supports most classic consoles from Atari,
Nintendo, Sega and SNK along with arcade emulation support. A number of retro
styled Raspberry Pi cases from &lt;a href="https://retroflag.com/">Retroflag&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://www.waveshare.com/product/raspberry-pi/portable-gaming.htm">Waveshare&lt;/a>

made a &lt;strong>DIY SNES Classic&lt;/strong> just in time for the Christmas holidays and it&amp;rsquo;s
very portable!&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To make one yourself you&amp;rsquo;ll need:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/">Raspberry Pi 3 Model B&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://retropie.org.uk/">Retropie 4.1&lt;/a> or newer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Two &lt;a href="http://www.8bitdo.com/snes30/">8Bitdo SNES30 wireless controllers&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A &lt;a href="https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/485061145/snes-3d-printed-case-raspberry-pi">SNES 3D Printed case&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/biscuits99/rp-video-manager">CRT scanline shaders&lt;/a> to complete the retro look on the big screen.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Both controllers use Bluetooth, so two player wire-free gaming is possible. The
USB cables are just for charging, but if you&amp;rsquo;ve got no charge they can be used
as wired controllers too. Retropie can be controlled via the controllers, no
keyboard/mouse required.&lt;/p></description><summary>I made my own &amp;ldquo;SNES Classic&amp;rdquo; with a Raspberry Pi</summary></item><item><title>Pocket Entertainment</title><link>https://wimpysworld.com/posts/pocket-entertainment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Aug 2005 09:36:08 +0000</pubDate><author>martin@wimpress.com (Martin Wimpress)</author><guid>https://wimpysworld.com/posts/pocket-entertainment/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently discovered &lt;a href="http://www.scummvm.org/">ScummVM&lt;/a> and have started playing
&lt;em>Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders&lt;/em> for the first time in years! ScummVM
allows you to run certain classic graphical point-and-click adventure games,
provided you already have their data files, allowing you to play them on
systems for which they were never designed!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, I decided to organise my old adventure games for use with ScummVM so that I
can enjoy them all again, but this has led to a couple of eBay bids to buy some
games I am missing. I have used the ScummVM tools to compress as the game data
files so I can fit the games on my iPAQ 4150. Life is good. I have been thinking
of getting a new solid state Ogg Vorbis compatible portable music player but
haven&amp;rsquo;t found one which completely suits my needs. So, my iPAQ 4150 is now
standing in as my portable music player too. This is thanks too the excellent
GSPlayer. I have configured my iPAQ 4150 to be a full time entertainment device.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am off to get myself a decent set of head phones today, more on that later&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description><summary>Using an iPAQ 4150 PocketPC for games &amp;amp; music</summary></item></channel></rss>
