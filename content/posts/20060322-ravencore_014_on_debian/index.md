I set up my new server to use [RavenCore](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ravencore/)
so that managing my domains and e-mail accounts for friends and family will be
as easy as possible. RavenCore is designed for use on CentOS primarily and
therefore RavenCore 0.1.4 requires some tweaking in order to get it fully
working and compatible with Debian.

I have been sharing my feedback with the RavenCore author and when RavenCore
0.1.5 is released "out of the box" Debian compatibility should be a reality.
