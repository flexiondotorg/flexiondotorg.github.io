Despite a generous offer from a Minerva enthusiast a year or so ago to freely
host the Project Minerva sites, all the Project Minerva hosting is coming back
to where it started and rightly belongs. Yes, right here with me. It just
goes to show you really don't get anything for free. The developers have had
several outages with the server which was provided by SpiderTech Hosting, so
we are bringing it back here where we can look after our interests directly.

Minerva users might be wondering if the fact I am fully hosting Project
Minerva again means I am going to be developing for the project again. Well,
we will just have to see but I did inform Chris of a little project I kicked
off last week which may (or may not) lead to something.
