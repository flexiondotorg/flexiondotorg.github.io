In a recent [Ubuntu community feedback session run on IRC](http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2012/05/01/%23ubuntu-classroom.html)

So, I did. I tried [Arch Linux](http://www.archlinux.org/) and it is is not
just good, it's truly brilliant! The truth is, I didn't take Mark
Shuttleworth's advice. I took the advice of a quietly spoken work colleague.
Whenever he saw me getting frustrated with Ubuntu he reminded me (quietly)
that he was running Arch Linux and that it was really rather good.
It turns out I should have listened to my colleague years ago, because he
was right all along. He often is.

I started learning Arch Linux a few weeks ago and as of the time of writing
all our home computers are running Arch Linux and so is my office workstation.
I moved away from Ubuntu (which I've been using daily since 2004) because:

  * I often find myself needing/wanting updated packages on my workstations.
Ubuntu + PPAs just wasn't doing it for me anymore. I concluded I needed a rolling
release distribution.
  * In my humble opinion, Unity is a software engineering solution developed
(by programmers) not designed using UI-patterns (by user interface designers)
consequently it sucks the big one.
  * It was less hassle for me to switch to Arch Linux than bend Ubuntu to my will.

That said, I do wish Canonical every success with Unity, they'll need it, as
it needs some polish and refinement as it stands today. For anyone interested
in giving Arch Linux a try here are some observations.

  * Arch Linux does not hold you hand, you should be competent with a Linux
    based distribution. I've been using Linux since 0.99patch2 so I think I qualify.
  * Read the [Unofficial Beginners' Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Beginners'_Guide)
    and [Official Installation Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Official_Arch_Linux_Install_Guide)
    before you install anything.
  * Install Arch Linux in a virtual machine to get acquainted.
  * Be prepared to fix _your_ own problems. Fortunately the
    [Arch Linux Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/) and [Arch Linux Forums](https://bbs.archlinux.org/)
    are a great source of good information.

Here is a list of what I most like about Arch Linux:

  * It's a rolling release. I've already progressed through several kernels
    and been upgraded from GNOME 3.2 to 3.4. No fuss, no mess.
  * It keeps out of my way, I get to build the OS they way I want it.
    _Yes, I'm looking at you Unity, Overlay Scrollbars, Unity App Indicators, Ubuntu One and upstart!_
  * The [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/index.php). It's like a great big PPA.
  * Creating my own packages is super simple.
  * Adding my own packages to the AUR is super simple. I've already contributed 8 packages.
  * I'm learning more about Linux than I have done in years.

Here's what I'm not so keen about, but can live with.

  * Some of the comments in the Forums and AUR are from real arse hats with a
    superiority complex. New comers may be put off by their tone and look elsewhere.
  * The [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/index.php). Package quality in the AUR
    is variable, some are pretty poor. So long as the maintainer is not one of the
    aforementioned arse hats then contributing fixes and improvements is easy.
  * It's a rolling release, so may not be suitable for serious server deployments.
    That said, I will migrate my own servers to Arch Linux in due course and see if
    I can prove myself wrong.

So there you have it, I like Arch Linux very much and recommend it to other
technically competent individuals looking to regain control of their computer(s).
