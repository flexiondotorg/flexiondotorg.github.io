Yesterday was a sad day. I finally notified the core [Minerva](http://sourceforge.net/projects/minerva/)
developers that I am leaving the project. Given that I started the project a few
years back it was not a decision I made lightly.

I have a couple of reasons for leaving the project, the main one being that I
just do not have the time available to effectively lead or contribute to the
project. All open source projects require good leadership and I haven't been able
to provide that for most of 2005. It is with the best interests of Minerva in
mind that I decided to leave.

However, Minerva is in very good hands and is under active development,
with Dave and Chris leading the effort. I wish all the Minerva developers and
users every success with the upcoming release of R4, it is a marvelous
achievement and I am sure will prove to be very successful. I will be
keeping an eye on R4 development, and if time permits, I may contribute some
blocks and modules in the future. Until then, good luck and make me proud!
