Inspired by the recent [NES Classic](http://www.nintendo.com/nes-classic/) I
made a **DIY SNES Classic** just in time for the Christmas holidays and it's
very portable!

To make one yourself you'll need:

  * [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/).
  * [Retropie 4.1](https://retropie.org.uk/) or newer.
  * Two [8Bitdo SNES30 wireless controllers](http://www.8bitdo.com/snes30/).
  * A [SNES 3D Printed case](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/485061145/snes-3d-printed-case-raspberry-pi).
  * [CRT scanline shaders](https://github.com/biscuits99/rp-video-manager) to complete the retro look on the big screen.

Both controllers use Bluetooth, so two player wire-free gaming is possible. The
USB cables are just for charging, but if you've got no charge they can be used
as wired controllers too. Retropie can be controlled via the controllers, no
keyboard/mouse required.
