I have replaced the disk in my Libretto CT100 with a 20GB disk I had going
spare and re-installed Debian Sarge 3.1, this time I didn't bother with the
2.6 kernel or Xfce because I've had my fun with those now. But playing
around with Linux on my Libretto has re-kindled my interested in running Linux
on small portable devices.

Earlier this year I experimented with [Familiar Linux](http://familiar.handhelds.org/)
0.8.2 on my iPAQ 3970 and installed via a serial cable, which was very slow
going. So I've invested in a 512MB Compact Flash card to speed up my next
round of tinkering with Familiar but this time I intend to leave Familiar
installed and not re-flash the 3970 with PocketPC 2002. The
[Familiar v0.8.2 Installation](http://familiar.handhelds.org/releases/v0.8.2/install/index.html)
guide covers pretty much everything you need to know about the installation
process.
