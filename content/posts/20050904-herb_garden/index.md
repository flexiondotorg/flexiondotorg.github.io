I finally got around to planting a small herb garden today, something I have
wanted to do ever since my wife and I designed the garden layout. The border
looks much better for being planted out but, once they are established, I
can't wait to start harvesting my new crop :smile:

So far I have planted Chive, Mint, Basil, Red Basil, Thyme, Lavender, Oregano,
Sage, Rosemary and Parsley. I just need to add some Coriander.
