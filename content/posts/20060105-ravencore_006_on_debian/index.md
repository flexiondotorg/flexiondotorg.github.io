I have been testing a few virtual hosting control panels the last couple of
days and I am deeply impressed with [RavenCore](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ravencore/),
so much so I will most likely use it for a project I am planning. However,
Debian is my server distro of choice and RavenCore needs a little tweaking in
order to work seamlessly with Debian. I have been keeping some notes that
explain how to get RavenCore to play nicely with Debian.

I have submitted my notes in the RavenCore Forums and agreed to assist the
author with any future testing to work toward better "out of the box" Debian
integration.
