I have been exchanging e-mails with the [UK distributor](http://www.convergent-av.co.uk)
for [Lumagen](http://www.lumagen.com) and the Lumagen engineering department.
Today is a happy day because I have just tested a pre-release firmware which
fully fixes the issues I've reported.

Thanks very much to the engineers at Lumagen amd for their patience and hard work.
Truly excellent customer service! See my post in the Lumagen forums.
