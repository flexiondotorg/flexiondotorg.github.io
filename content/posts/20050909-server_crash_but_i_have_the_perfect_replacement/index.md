The CPU fan on my home server stopped spinning, which has rendered the computer
unusable until I find the time to replace it. I have my workstation, so I can
keep working for the most part, but the services I was running on the server
are critical so I need a server replacement ASAP. I have decided to setup a
dedicated server for those services.

I always knew my Libretto CT100 would come in handy someday. With 64MB RAM
and a Pentium 166mhz MMX CPU I think it will make an excellent server. Although
I may upgrade the hard disk from 2.1GB to 20GB. I am undecided which distro I'll
install, probably Ubuntu 5.10 or Debian 3.1, but because the Libretto CT100
has weird hardware this install is not straight forward. The following web pages
seem to be the most useful to me right now:

  * [Installing Debian Linux 3.1 Sarge on Toshiba Libretto 50](http://www.geocities.com/davissharonforest/)
  * [Installing RedHat Linux on a Toshiba Libretto 100CT](http://www.redgrittybrick.org/linux/libretto.html)
    * Has good background information on the hardware and hibernation partition

There are several other installs documented on the [Linux on Toshiba Laptop and Notebook Computers](http://www.linux-on-laptops.com/toshiba.html) page.
