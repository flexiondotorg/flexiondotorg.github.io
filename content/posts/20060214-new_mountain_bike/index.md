I finally convinced my wife that I need (really wanted) a new mountain
bike and today I took delivery of the [Trek 4300 Disc 2006 model](http://www.trekbikes.com/uk/en/bikes/2006/archive/4300disc)

I managed to fall off it on the maiden voyage but I thought it best to get that
out that way before I tackle to Bracknell Woods this coming Sunday.
