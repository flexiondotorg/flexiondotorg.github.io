I have updated my HOW-TO for installing [RavenCore](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ravencore/)
on Debian (at the request of the RavenCore developer) and added a HOW-TO for
installing RavenCore on Ubuntu. The are still some minor compatibility issues
with Debian and Ubuntu and these HOW-TOs have been sent to the RavenCore
developer to help document the outstanding incompatibilities.
