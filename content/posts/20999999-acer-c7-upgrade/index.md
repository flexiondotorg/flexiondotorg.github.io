I believe that you don't actually own a device until you void its warrenty. So
with that in mind, when I set out to buy a budget Chromebook, I was keen that
the model I chose could be upgraded.

I opted for the Acer C7 because it is without doubt the most voidable ;-)

PAE means that the Acer C7 can actually support a maximum of 16GB RAM. The HDD
can be replaced with SDD and the battery can be replaced with one offering more
capacity. Has HDMI. Initial reports indicate better compatibility than the ARM
based Samsung Series 3 and timely updates.
