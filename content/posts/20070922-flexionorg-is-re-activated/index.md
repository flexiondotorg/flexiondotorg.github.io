I have finally got around to re-activating this website after many months of
neglect. The first thing to do was move away from [Jaws](http://jaws-project.com/).
Sadly, my Jaws installation is broken in a way that newer Jaws releases refuse
to upgrade it.

I did some research and decided to migrate to [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.org)
since it caters for all the essentials I require either in the core
functionality or via plugins. Plus I can integrate with some other stuff I want
to use.

The migration to Wordpress was made all the easier thanks to the excellent [Jaws import plugin](http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4184)
I found on the Wordpress trac. However, I decided not to use the Textile plugin
to preserve the Jaws formatted text. Instead I chose to manually clean up some
of the old entries so I could stick with the TinyMCE editor long term.

I am happy with Wordpress thus far and look forward to getting some plugins
going and picking up a new theme over the coming days and weeks.
