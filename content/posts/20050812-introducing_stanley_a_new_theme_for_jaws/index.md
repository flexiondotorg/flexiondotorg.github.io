I've finished hacking together a new theme for [Jaws](http://jaws-project.com/)
0.5.x, which I have named Stanley, and is now the default theme on this site.
I've still got to fix a couple of bugs and make sure that it is compatible with
browsers other than Firefox. I wanted a theme which was crisp and clean, but
also fully compatible with Jaws, so I decided to blend some of my favourite
themes together. Stanley is inspired by the Kubrick theme which is popular among
bloggers and although the Kubrick graphics have been borrowed the style sheet
and layout are derived from the `jaws`, `orange-grey` and `simple-green`
themes which are bundled with Jaws. As a result Stanley is properly Jaws
compatible, in that left and right layouts work, all the CSS elements are
supported and CSS tweaks are used throughout to improve the visual appeal.
