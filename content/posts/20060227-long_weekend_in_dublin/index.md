We just got back from an enjoyable trip to Dublin, highlights for me were
visits to the...

  * [Guinness Storehouse](http://www.guinnessstorehouse.com/home/home.asp) for a history lesson and a drop of the black stuff.
  * [The Old Jameson Distillery](http://www.whiskeytours.ie/dublin/dubhistoryn.html) for another history lesson and a drop of the hard stuff, I also certified as an Irish Whiskey taster during the visit. I have a certificate and everything :-)
  * [Gallagher's Boxty House](http://www.boxtyhouse.ie/default.htm) for some traditional Irish grub.
  * [Ryanair's](http://www.ryanair.com/site/EN/) ticket prices, just 10p return each!

This was our first visit to Ireland and I am looking forward to going back again
soon and maybe incorporate some diving.
