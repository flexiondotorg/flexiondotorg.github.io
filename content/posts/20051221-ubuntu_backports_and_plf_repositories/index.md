I haven't been focusing on Linux during that last couple of months, I was a
bit distracted completing my home cinema installation and ever since I have
been watching a lot of films.

However, I needed to get one of my laptops up to date for the Christmas holidays
and in doing so needed some packages from the Ubuntu Backports repository, which
led me to find the [Ubuntu Penguin Liberation Front](http://plf.zarb.org/).

The Ubuntu PLF is a team that builds packages that are patent encumbered or
proprietary. The PLF has been providing litigious packages for Mandriva for many
years and now they are doing the same thing for Ubuntu. Having added the Breezy
Backports and PLF repositories (just about) everything I consider essential for
my desktop needs is now apt-getable, yah!
