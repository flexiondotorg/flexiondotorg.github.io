Today I finally got around to ordering some stuff from Amazon.co.uk using the
vouchers I was given as present at Christmas. I have ordered The Matrix
Trilogy and The Lord of the Rings Trilogy (Extended Edition Box Set) which I
hope arrive before the weekend as my wife is away for a few days which should be
enough time to get through both box sets `:-)`
