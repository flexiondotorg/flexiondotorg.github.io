I picked up a pair of new earbuds yesterday. I decided on the
[Sony MDR-EX71SL](https://www.cnet.com/reviews/sony-fontopia-mdr-ex71sl-review/)
earbuds as all the reviews I have read have been very positive, and after
listening to a few of my favourite albums with them, I am also very impressed
with their performance. Due to their earbud design nearly all background noise
is eliminated meaning you can hear your music very clearly at lower volumes,
this good for preserving your hearing and also prevents you from annoying
people nearby with noise bleed from the headphones. Bass performance is
especially good and you get three different sizes silicon ear bud so everyone
should be able to get a comfortable fit, the smallest size is best for me. I
chose to get a black pair but the are also available in white for iPod owners.
