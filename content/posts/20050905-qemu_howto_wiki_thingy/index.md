[Adam Tricket](http://use.perl.org/~ajt/journal/) got a few people interested
in [QEMU](http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu/index.html) at the HantsLUG
meeting on Saturday 3rd September 2005. Having recently discovered the wonders
of QEMU myself I couldn't help but get involved in the conversation. Me and my
big mouth! I somehow managed to lumber myself with the job of writing a Wiki
page about QEMU for the HantsLUG website. The page is more or less useful
now and you can read it here...
