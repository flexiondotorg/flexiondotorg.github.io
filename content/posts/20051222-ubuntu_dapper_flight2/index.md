I decided to install Ubuntu Dapper Flight-2 on a spare computer I had available.
There are not any obvious differences between Dapper and Breezy at this early
stage but one thing which does stand out is the performance improvements. My
test Dapper and stable Breezy computers are exactly the same specification and
the boot times for Dapper are vastly improved, currently 37 seconds (average)
faster from power on to GNOME desktop than with Breezy. The graphical boot menu
when booting from the install CD in a nice touch, I look forward to seeing how
Dapper improves over the coming months. But right now there isn't anything
especially new, different or unusual to test.
