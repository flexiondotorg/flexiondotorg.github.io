I manage several websites at work and have therefore learned something about
search engine optimisation (SEO). Our main site at work uses
[Wordpress](http:/www.wordpress.org) as the content manager, which has good
SEO features by default. Last week we launched a new website and I also
refreshed the other sites, in so doing I found a great article discussing how
to fully SEO your Wordpress site. It is a good read even if you don't use
Wordpress, but for those of you that do, it recommends a suite of plugins that
do all the hard work for you.
