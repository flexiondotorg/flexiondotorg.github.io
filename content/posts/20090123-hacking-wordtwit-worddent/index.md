I have quickly forked [WordTwit](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordtwit/) into
WordDent. WordDent is a Wordpress plugin that utilizes the Twitter API to
automatically push a published post to your [Identi.ca](http://identi.ca)
account as a dent. It allows all your Identi.ca contacts to keep up to date
with your blog postings. I'm still just testing that WordDent works
correctly. I'll find out if the nice people over at
[Brave New Code](http://www.bravenewcode.com) will agree to me releasing
WordDent since I can't fine any license details for WordTwit.
