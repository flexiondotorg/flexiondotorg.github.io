Tonight was a landmark occasion. After nearly two years of planning I finally
completed our home cinema. The last job was mounting the plasma screen. Apart
from hiding away some power cables it is complete and I can't wait to get into
some serious film viewing. Mounting the plasma screen was not a job I was
looking forward as DIY is not my strong suit. But, I managed it and posted my
experiences in the topic below at AVForums.
