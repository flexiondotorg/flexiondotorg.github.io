First of all, I have disabled comments on my blog. [Jaws](http://jaws-project.com/)
has spam protection and captachs but both implementations suck. This site doesn't
generate much feedback so disabling comments altogether is not really a problem.
I haven't updated the site recently and here is why. The 0.6.x release of Jaws
is buggy and I still haven't found anything else which fully meets my needs for
managing my own web content.

Therefore for the last couple of months I have been working on an open source
CMS of my own called R3-born. More details to follow about that soon, but you
can find the project over at Sourceforge, don't expect anything to work
(although it does for the most part) it is pre-alpha and unreleased. SVN is the
only way to snag the source.
