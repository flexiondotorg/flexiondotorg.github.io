When I setup the mail server at work I picked [Zimbra](http://www.zimbra.com/).
It's great.

Today Zimbra just got a bit better when I found [Zindus](http://www.zindus.com).
Zindus is open source software and runs on all Thunderbird platforms including
Windows, Mac OSX and Linux. Zindus can sync your contacts between Zimbra and
Thunderbird. It syncs everything from Address Books to your GAL (Global Address List).

It currently supports ZCS 3.x to 5.x. Adding the [Lightning](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/)
and Zindus add-ons to Thunderbird create a very complete desktop client to
Zimbra for any platform. Can't wait to share to good news with my Outlook users.
