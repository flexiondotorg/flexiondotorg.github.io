I've finally found a photo organiser for Linux I can live with,
[Shotwell](http://yorba.org/shotwell/). Shotwell is a photo organiser
for [GNOME](http://www.gnome.org) that I've been testing for a few
months now but the recent 0.5 release which added tagging and printing,
it means Shotwell is finally ready replace [F-Spot](http://f-spot.org) on
my workstation.

Shotwell is intuitive, well documented, extremely easy to use and reliable.
It's easy to dismiss Shotwell as an over simplified photo manager. But once
you start using it, you'll quickly appreciate its clean interface and
easy-to-use tools. Don't just take my word for it either, Shotwell is now the
default photo manager in [Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org) 13 alpha. Here is
a quick run down of the features.

  * Import photos from folders or from any digital camera supported by gPhoto.
  * Shotwell automatically groups photos taken at the same time. You can also
    use tags to organize your photo collection.
  * You can rotate, crop, reduce red-eye, and adjust the exposure, saturation,
    tint, and temperature of each photo.
  * Publish photos to Facebook, Flickr and Picasa Web Albums.

Shotwell provides a non-destructive way to tweak your photos. Instead of
modifying the original photos, Shotwell stores all edits in a database and
applies them on-the-fly as necessary. This means that you can easily undo all
edits. Shotwell comes equipped with all the usual photo enhancing tools and
slideshow. You can download a source tarball from the Shotwell home page at
<http://www.yorba.org/shotwell/> or grab a binary for Ubuntu Karmic or Lucid
via Yorba's Launchpad PPA.
