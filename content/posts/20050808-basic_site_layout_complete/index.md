After fiddling around with the [Jaws](http://jaws-project.com/) setup for a while
I have finally settled on something which I'm happy with. Once I found the
`default_page` setting in the registry I was very happy. I'll enable more
gadgets (plugins) as I find a use for them, but my next task will probably be
creating my own theme or at least combining ideas from several existing themes.
