Finally, R3-born 0.1.0 is released. [R3-born](http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/r3-born/)
is a content management system for modest websites which I hope will be ideal for
individuals running their own sites or small community websites.

Due to my accident I have not been able to address all of the bugs which have
been reported recently and the downloads are only available as bzip2 tarballs
right now. Please report any bugs you might encounter as 0.1.0 has really only
been tested on Debian Sarge (stable) running PHP4 and MSQL 4. Feedback from
other configurations will be useful and all reported bugs will be investigated.
