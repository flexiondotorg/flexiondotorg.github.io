I have updated my HOW-TO for installing [RavenCore](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ravencore/)
0.1.5 on Debian. I'm pleased to report that the RavenCore developer has been
very responsive to my feedback and has significantly improved "out of the box"
Debian compatibility in this release. The are still some minor compatibility
issues and I've' sent feedback to the developer in the hope that things will
continue to improve with RavenCore 0.1.6.
