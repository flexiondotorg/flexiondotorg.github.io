I had previously read on Yahoo Groups that a project was under way to retro
fit a USB interface to the PaceTwin PVR allowing for easy archiving of recorded
programs to a computer. Well, the guy who is planning the DIY upgrade has
setup a website which is documenting progress and also other useful PaceTwin
information. See the URL below for more information...
