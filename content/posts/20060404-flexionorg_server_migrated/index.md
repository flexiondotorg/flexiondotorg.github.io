Today Flexion.Org was successfully migrated to a new server. I've been using
the same shared host for over 7 years but these days I really need much better
control over my server, mostly for spam/virus protection of e-mail but also to
ensure that periodic upgrades don't screw up my website.

So this time I opted for a virtual dedicated server and I had a choice of all
the popular Linux distros, which I can re-install via a web interface at will
in a few seconds. I choose. If you are looking for a low cost virtual dedicated
server then take a look at [Quantact](http://www.quantact.com).
