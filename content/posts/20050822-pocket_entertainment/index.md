I recently discovered [ScummVM](http://www.scummvm.org/) and have started playing
*Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders* for the first time in years! ScummVM
allows you to run certain classic graphical point-and-click adventure games,
provided you already have their data files, allowing you to play them on
systems for which they were never designed!

So, I decided to organise my old adventure games for use with ScummVM so that I
can enjoy them all again, but this has led to a couple of eBay bids to buy some
games I am missing. I have used the ScummVM tools to compress as the game data
files so I can fit the games on my iPAQ 4150. Life is good. I have been thinking
of getting a new solid state Ogg Vorbis compatible portable music player but
haven't found one which completely suits my needs. So, my iPAQ 4150 is now
standing in as my portable music player too. This is thanks too the excellent
GSPlayer. I have configured my iPAQ 4150 to be a full time entertainment device.

I am off to get myself a decent set of head phones today, more on that later...
