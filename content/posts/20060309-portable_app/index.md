I started a new job last week, I am contracting for the first time. I needed
some applications installed on my desktop at work, but to do so would not be
permitted as part of my clients standard build policies.

So I started making a USB disk with the tools I needed and in doing do I found
the [Portableapp](http://portableapps.com/) and [The Portable Freeware Collection](http://www.portablefreeware.com/)
websites which ease the process no end.

A portable app is a computer program that you can carry around with you on a
portable device and use on any Windows computer. When your USB thumb drive,
portable hard drive, iPod or other portable device is plugged in, you have
access to your software and personal data just as you would on your own PC. And
when you unplug, none of your personal data is left behind.
