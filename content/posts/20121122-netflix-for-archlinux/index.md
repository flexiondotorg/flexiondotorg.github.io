Something wonderful has happened! [Jesus Alvarez](http://demizerone.com/) has
created pre-compiled packages for `netflix-desktop` for Arch Linux.

There is no need for me to repeat the installation instructions as they are
clearly documented on the page below.

  * [Arch Netflix - Netflix on the desktop through WINE](http://demizerone.com/archnetflix/)

The source code for both of the packages can be found at [archnetflix-github](https://github.com/demizer/archnetflix).

For reporting problems, please see the AUR page at [netflix-desktop-aur](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/netflix-desktop) or the [announcement forum posting](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1196370).
