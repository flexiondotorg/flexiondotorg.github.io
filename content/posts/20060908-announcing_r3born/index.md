I suppose it is a bit silly to announce this just before I go on holiday but
what the heck. [R3-born](http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/r3-born/) is
intended to be a simple and modular content management system for modest websites.
My hope is that it will be ideal for individuals running their own sites or for
small community websites. R3-born is coded in PHP (4.2.0 or better required)
and requires an SQL database, currently MySQL 3.x, 4.x and 5.x, Postgres 7.x
or better and MS-SQL 7.x or better are supported.

## Current Status

Right now, R3-born is considered pre-alpha and not suitable for a production
website but is ready for testers to start feeding back on bugs, feature requests
and in the near future code changes. Development has been fairly rapid so far. I
started the project in April 2006 and I hope to release a beta version of
R3-born later in 2006.
