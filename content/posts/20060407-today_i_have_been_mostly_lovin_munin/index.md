Here's the blurb from the authors... [Munin](http://munin.projects.linpro.no/)
surveys all your computers and remembers what it saw. It presents all the
information in in graphs through a web interface. Its emphasis is on plug and
play capabilities. After completing a installation a high number of monitoring
plugins will be playing with no more effort. Using Munin you can easily
monitor the performance of your computers, networks, SANs, and quite possibly
applications as well. It makes it easy to determine "what's different today"
when a performance problem crops up. It makes it easy to see how you're doing
capacity wise on all limited resources.
