I have built an initial prototype of a Linux based PVR using some (very) old
hardware I had available. I simply plugged in a new [Hauppauge Nova-T
PCI](http://www.hauppauge.co.uk/pages/products/data_novatpci.html) card and
hoped for the best. I got everything working but had to fudge things so that
over the air electronic program guide (EPG) can be imported into the MythTV
program guide database.

This initial prototype uses [KnoppMyth](http://mysettopbox.tv/) Release 5A16 so
that I could get up to speed as quickly as possible but I plan on using Debian
or Ubuntu in the future.
