Yesterday I needed to create a data flow diagram for one of our
technology partners at work. They are presenting to the [FAA](http://www.faa.gov/)
and need to explain how we ([Flight Data Services](http://www.flightdataservices.com))
can replay the data from tens of thousands of flights in extremely short order.

Anyway, I went looking for a good tool to draw the diagram. I've
tried several in the past and never really been satisfied. I found
[draw.io](http://www.draw.io/about.html) and it is really good.
This is how they describe it.

The shape library is extensive and pretty consistent. I was able
to export the diagram in the formats I wanted. Overall, it's not
half bad and completely free.
