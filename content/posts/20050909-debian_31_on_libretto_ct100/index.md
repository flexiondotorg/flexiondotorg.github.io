I decided to stick with the 2.1GB hard disk in the end, but in order to
complete the initial install I fitted it in an old IBM Thinkpad 600X. This
allowed me to boot off the Debian 3.1 Net Install CD and get a basic system
installed. Once that was done I fitted the hard disk back in the Libretto and
installed the essential bits and pieces I needed. I am feeling a lot of love
for `apt-get` today.

Then I got carried away. I upgraded to the 2.6 kernel, installed X and
Xfce 4.2.2. Then I migrated to the testing repositories, the upgrade for which
has finished a few minutes ago. I found Quentin Stafford-Fraser's
[Linux on the Libretto 100CT](http://www.qandr.org/quentin/libretto/) page very
helpful in finding the right Modeline settings to get X going. I don't really
need Xfce on the Libretto but I couldn't resist getting it running. Despite the
low spec processor and just 64MB of RAM it runs very well, even Firefox is
usable. I might have to bring this box along to the next HantsLUG meeting.
