Despite my glowing comments about [Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org/) a couple
of weeks back, the honeymoon period is well and truly over. My biggest gripe
with Fedora is even with numerous compatible repositories enabled there isn't a
suitable selection of packages available and dependency breakage is all too
frequent.

Although I can build my own packages from source I just don't have the time
(or inclination) for that anymore. I do really like the Early Logon feature and
the working NetworkManager in Fedora, but sadly these features are not enough to
keep me away from Ubuntu. As a result I have just finished migrating all my
computers to Ubuntu Dapper Drake 6.04 - Flight 3, which is shaping up to be
another excellent release. Matt Galvin has been doing a great job of tracking
the new features in each of the Dapper Flight pre-releases, see the Wiki entries
below...

Having spent 6 weeks using Fedora I have decided that I have learnt enough
about it to conclude it just isn't for me and I will be seeing out the rest of
2006 using Ubuntu as my desktop OS. However, I will dabble with other distros
periodically.
