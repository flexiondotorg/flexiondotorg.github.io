PlayStation 3 firmware 3.00 added a new feature I was very excited about,
multi-av output. Today I finally got round to re-wiring the home cinema system
to make use of this new feature. I now have the PS3 streaming music from
[MediaTomb](http://mediatomb.cc/) with my A/V receiver sending audio to Zone
1 via digital inter connects and also sending audio to Zone 2 via analog stereo
interconnects.

Zone 1 is a 5.1 speaker setup and Zone 2 is a 2.0 all weather wireless speaker
system which are often in the kitchen but also moved outside for parties. If
Sony could just add Skype to the PS3 and allow the PSP Remote Play to output
audio to both the PS3 and PSP (rather than just one of them) I would be very
happy indeed.
