Last week I switched from [VMware](http://www.vmware.com/) to
[VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.com/) at home. Why? Well, hack value
mostly and I also wanted to learn more about VirtualBox having never used it
before.

Bottom line, for home use it suits me very nicely and is far easier to
get installed and running when compared to VMware Server which almost always
required patching. The VirtualBox and Guest Additions (think VMWare Tools)
installers both worked without a hitch. I even migrated my existing VMware
Linux guests to VirtualBox, again everything went smoothly and my existing
`.vmdk` disks worked just fine.
