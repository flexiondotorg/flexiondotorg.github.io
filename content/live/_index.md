My Twitch and YouTube channels are a celebration of Desktop Linux 🐧 and
include live coding on various projects such as Debian, Ubuntu, MATE Desktop 🧉,
Nix ❄ and making Raspberry Pi devices. I'm an OBS Studio nerd 🤓 and love to
tinker with effects and interactive features. If you stream using Linux and
have questions, please do ask 👍

Although the channels were started by me, it has become a place for our
community to create new projects, collaborate, learn and succeed together.
