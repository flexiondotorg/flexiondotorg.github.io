Ubuntu comes with everything you need to run your organisation, school, home or
enterprise. All the essential applications, like an office suite, browsers,
email and media apps come pre-installed.

Community contributor since 2006, worked for Canonical from 2016 to 2021
progressing from software engineer to director of engineering. I remain active
in the Ubuntu community.
