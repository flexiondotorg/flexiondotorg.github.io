[Arch Linux ](https://archlinux.org) is a Linux distribution that uses a rolling
release model, such that a regular system update is all that is needed to obtain
all the latest software. The design approach follows the KISS principle
(<i>"keep it simple, stupid"</i>) and focuses on elegance, code correctness,
minimalism and simplicity.
