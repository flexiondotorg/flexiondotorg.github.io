Led the design, development and operation of the POLARIS project at
[Flight Data Services](https://flightdataservices.com). An Open Source analysis
engine developed using Python that can scale to analyse and report on millions
of commercial aviation flights to comply with global aviation safety regulations.
Now known as Flight Data Connect and owned by L3HARRIS and apparently no longer
available as Open Source.
