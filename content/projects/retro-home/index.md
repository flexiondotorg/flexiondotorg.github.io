[Retro Home](https://github.com/wimpysworld/retro-home) is custom Raspberry Pi
operating system purpose built for retro gaming. Built with
[Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) and using the minimalist emulator frontend
[Ludo](https://ludo.libretro.com/) it supports most classic consoles from Atari,
Nintendo, Sega and SNK along with arcade emulation support. A number of retro
styled Raspberry Pi cases from [Retroflag](https://retroflag.com/) and
[Waveshare](https://www.waveshare.com/product/raspberry-pi/portable-gaming.htm)
are supported (with more in the works) using bespoke GPIO drivers.
